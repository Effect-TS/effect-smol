# Graph Module Implementation Plan

## Overview
Design and implement a comprehensive Graph module for the Effect library that provides immutable graph data structures, stack-safe algorithms, and efficient scoped mutable operations.

**IMPORTANT**: This plan has been updated to use plain numbers for NodeIndex and EdgeIndex instead of branded types for simplicity and reduced API noise. IndexAllocator pattern has been removed in favor of simple monotonic counters.

### API Design Principles
- **String Literals over Tagged Objects**: Use simple string literals (`"Continue"`, `"Break"`, `"Prune"`) instead of tagged objects (`{ _tag: "Continue" }`) for ControlFlow to create a clean, user-friendly API that avoids anti-patterns
- **Plain Numbers over Branded Types**: Use plain `number` types for NodeIndex and EdgeIndex instead of branded types to reduce API noise and improve developer experience
- **Simplicity over Type Safety**: Prioritize clean, easy-to-use APIs over complex type constructs when the benefits outweigh the costs
- **JavaScript-First Design**: Prefer string literals over enums/classes, avoid redundant class/interface usage while maintaining functionality

### Petgraph-Inspired Design Goals
Following successful patterns from https://github.com/petgraph/petgraph while adapting for JavaScript/TypeScript and Effect's functional paradigm:

#### **Petgraph Analysis & Adaptation Strategy**
- **Petgraph Approach**: Uses both walker patterns (`Dfs`, `Bfs` structs) AND visitor patterns (`depth_first_search()` function)
- **Petgraph Control Flow**: Type-safe `Control` enum with `Continue`, `Break(value)`, `Prune` variants
- **Our Adaptation**: 
  - Unified visitor-only pattern fits Effect's functional approach better
  - String literals (`"Continue" | "Break" | "Prune"`) are more JavaScript-idiomatic than enums
  - Single `nodes()` function reduces API surface while maintaining petgraph's traversal capabilities

#### **Key Petgraph Patterns to Follow**
1. **Dual Algorithm Support**: Like petgraph's `Dfs`/`Bfs`, support both via algorithm parameter
2. **Direction Control**: Like petgraph's neighbor direction control, support bidirectional traversal  
3. **Event-Driven Traversal**: Like petgraph's `DfsEvent`, provide event-based visitor callbacks
4. **Control Flow Management**: Like petgraph's `Control` enum, provide `Continue`/`Break`/`Prune` semantics
5. **Iterator Compatibility**: Like petgraph's walker-to-iterator conversion, make traversals naturally iterable

#### **JavaScript/Effect Adaptations**
- **No Classes**: Avoid petgraph's struct-based walkers, use pure functions instead
- **String Literals**: Use `"Continue"` instead of `Control::Continue` for JS ecosystem fit
- **Functional Composition**: Leverage Effect's pipe operator and function composition
- **Immutable State**: Unlike petgraph's mutable walker state, keep traversal stateless

## Next Phase: Enhanced Petgraph-Inspired Algorithms

Following petgraph's comprehensive algorithm suite more closely while maintaining JavaScript/TypeScript idioms:

### **Priority 1: Core Graph Algorithms (Missing from Current Implementation)**

#### **Graph Structure Analysis** - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ `isAcyclic()` - Check if graph is acyclic (extends existing cycle flag)
- ✅ `isBipartite()` - Check if undirected graph is bipartite  
- ✅ `stronglyConnectedComponents()` - Find SCCs using Kosaraju's algorithm
- ✅ `connectedComponents()` - Find connected components in undirected graphs
- ✅ `topologicalSort()` - Topological ordering for DAGs

#### **Path Finding Algorithms**
- `shortestPath()` - Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs
- `shortestPaths()` - All shortest paths from source (Dijkstra variant)
- `allPairsShortestPaths()` - Floyd-Warshall algorithm
- `hasPath()` - Simple path existence check using BFS/DFS

#### **Minimum Spanning Tree**
- `minimumSpanningTree()` - Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm for MST
- `minimumSpanningForest()` - MST for disconnected graphs

### **Priority 2: Advanced Algorithms**

#### **Network Analysis**
- `bridges()` - Find bridge edges (cut edges)
- `articulationPoints()` - Find articulation vertices (cut vertices)
- `pageRank()` - PageRank algorithm for directed graphs

#### **Matching & Flow** 
- `maximumMatching()` - Maximum matching in bipartite graphs
- `maxFlow()` - Ford-Fulkerson maximum flow algorithm

### **Implementation Strategy: Petgraph-Inspired with JS/Effect Patterns**

#### **API Design Principles**
```typescript
// Follow petgraph naming but use JS conventions
Graph.isAcyclic(graph) // boolean result, not Option<bool>
Graph.shortestPath(graph, source, target) // Option<Path> result
Graph.stronglyConnectedComponents(graph) // Array<Array<NodeIndex>>

// Use string literals for algorithm variants
Graph.minimumSpanningTree(graph, algorithm?: "kruskal" | "prim")
Graph.shortestPaths(graph, source, algorithm?: "dijkstra" | "bellman-ford")

// Return Effect types for error handling where appropriate
Graph.topologicalSort(graph) // Effect<Array<NodeIndex>, CycleError>
Graph.allPairsShortestPaths(graph) // Effect<DistanceMatrix, NegativeCycleError>
```

#### **Data Structure Enhancements**
- **Edge Weights**: Extend EdgeData to support numeric weights
- **Path Results**: Create Path type for representing graph paths
- **Component Results**: Use Array<Array<NodeIndex>> for component groupings
- **Distance Matrix**: Efficient representation for all-pairs algorithms

#### **Performance Considerations**
- Use MutableHashMap for internal algorithm state
- Implement algorithms with stack-safe iterative approaches
- Leverage existing visitor pattern for complex traversals
- Cache algorithm results where appropriate (e.g., SCC, topological order)

### **Phase Organization**

#### **Phase 5A: Graph Structure Algorithms**
- Implement `isAcyclic()`, `isBipartite()`, `stronglyConnectedComponents()`
- Add comprehensive tests with known graph structures
- Update JSDoc with algorithm complexity and use cases

#### **Phase 5B: Path Finding Suite**
- Implement Dijkstra's algorithm variants
- Add path reconstruction utilities
- Support both weighted and unweighted graphs

#### **Phase 5C: Advanced Analysis**
- Implement MST algorithms
- Add network analysis tools (bridges, articulation points)
- Create specialized result types

#### **Phase 5D: Algorithm Integration**
- Ensure all algorithms work with existing traversal patterns
- Add algorithm composition utilities
- Create performance benchmarks against reference implementations

### **Avoiding Over-Engineering**
- **No Class Hierarchies**: Keep functional approach even for complex algorithms
- **String-Based Configuration**: Use union types instead of enum classes
- **Effect Integration**: Return Effect types only where error conditions are meaningful
- **Minimal Type Complexity**: Favor clear, simple types over complex generic constraints

## Phase 1: Core Data Structure Design

### 1.1 Graph Representation
Internal data structure is always mutable for performance, with immutability guaranteed through API design:

```typescript
// Core graph structure - always mutable internally
interface GraphData<N, E> {
  readonly nodes: MutableHashMap<number, N>
  readonly edges: MutableHashMap<number, EdgeData<E>>
  readonly adjacency: MutableHashMap<number, Array<number>>
  readonly reverseAdjacency: MutableHashMap<number, Array<number>> // For undirected graphs
  nodeCount: number
  edgeCount: number
  nextNodeIndex: number
  nextEdgeIndex: number
  // Cycle tracking flag for efficient cycle detection
  isAcyclic: boolean | null  // null = unknown, true = acyclic, false = has cycles
}

// Edge data includes source, target, and weight/data
interface EdgeData<E> {
  readonly source: number
  readonly target: number
  readonly data: E
}

// Index types - simple numbers for performance and simplicity
export type NodeIndex = number
export type EdgeIndex = number
```

### 1.2 Graph Type Variants
Immutable and mutable graph interfaces with controlled access:

```typescript
// Immutable graph interface - read-only access
interface Graph<N, E, T extends GraphType = GraphType.Mixed> {
  readonly [TypeId]: TypeId
  readonly data: GraphData<N, E>
  readonly type: T
  readonly _mutable: false  // Type-level marker for immutable
}

// Mutable graph interface - allows modifications
interface MutableGraph<N, E, T extends GraphType = GraphType.Mixed> {
  readonly [TypeId]: TypeId
  readonly data: GraphData<N, E>  // Same underlying structure
  readonly type: T
  readonly _mutable: true  // Type-level marker for mutable
}

// Graph type markers
namespace GraphType {
  export interface Directed extends GraphType.Base {}
  export interface Undirected extends GraphType.Base {}
  export interface Mixed extends GraphType.Base {}
}

// Specific graph types
export type DirectedGraph<N, E> = Graph<N, E, GraphType.Directed>
export type UndirectedGraph<N, E> = Graph<N, E, GraphType.Undirected>
export type MixedGraph<N, E> = Graph<N, E, GraphType.Mixed>

export type MutableDirectedGraph<N, E> = MutableGraph<N, E, GraphType.Directed>
export type MutableUndirectedGraph<N, E> = MutableGraph<N, E, GraphType.Undirected>
export type MutableMixedGraph<N, E> = MutableGraph<N, E, GraphType.Mixed>
```

### 1.3 Index Management
Simple monotonic index allocation:

```typescript
// Simple index allocation using plain counters
// Removed IndexAllocator interface in favor of simple nextNodeIndex/nextEdgeIndex counters
// Benefits: Simpler code, no index recycling complexity, predictable behavior
// Trade-off: Index gaps after node/edge removal (acceptable for most use cases)
```

## Phase 2: Basic Graph Operations

### 2.1 Graph Construction and Read Operations
```typescript
// Graph creation - always returns immutable graphs
export const directed: <N, E>() => DirectedGraph<N, E>
export const undirected: <N, E>() => UndirectedGraph<N, E>
export const make: <N, E>(nodes: Array<N>, edges: Array<[number, number, E]>) => Graph<N, E>

// Read-only operations work on both Graph and MutableGraph
export const getNode: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>, index: number) => Option<N>
export const hasNode: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>, index: number) => boolean
export const getEdge: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>, index: number) => Option<EdgeData<E>>
export const hasEdge: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>, source: number, target: number) => boolean

// Basic properties - work on both types
export const size: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>) => number
export const nodeCount: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>) => number
export const edgeCount: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>) => number
export const isEmpty: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>) => boolean

// Adjacency queries - work on both types
export const neighbors: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>, node: number) => Array<number>
export const inNeighbors: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>, node: number) => Array<number>
export const outNeighbors: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>, node: number) => Array<number>
export const degree: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>, node: number) => number
export const inDegree: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>, node: number) => number
export const outDegree: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>, node: number) => number
```

### 2.2 Mutable Operations (Only Accept MutableGraph)
```typescript
// Mutation operations - ONLY accept MutableGraph, never Graph
export const addNode: <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>, data: N) => number
export const removeNode: <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>, index: number) => void
export const addEdge: <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>, source: number, target: number, data: E) => number
export const removeEdge: <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>, index: number) => void
export const updateNode: <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>, index: number, data: N) => void
export const updateEdge: <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>, index: number, data: E) => void

// Cycle flag management for mutation operations:
// - addEdge: Invalidates cycle flag (structure changed, may introduce cycles)
// - removeEdge: Invalidates cycle flag (structure changed, may break cycles)
// - removeNode: Invalidates cycle flag (removes node and all incident edges)
// - addNode: Preserves cycle flag (adding isolated node doesn't affect cyclicity)

// No Graph.addNode, Graph.removeNode, etc. - these functions don't exist!
// Immutable graphs can only be modified through the mutable API
```

## Phase 3: Stack-Safe Traversal Primitives

### 3.1 Core Walker Primitives
Stack-safe traversal without Effect overhead, following petgraph's walker pattern:

```typescript
// Base walker interface - iterator pattern without graph references
interface Walker<T> {
  readonly next: (graph: Graph<any, any> | MutableGraph<any, any>) => Option<T>
  readonly reset: () => void
}

// Node walker for traversing nodes
export interface NodeWalker extends Walker<number> {
  readonly stack: Array<number>
  readonly discovered: HashSet<number>
  readonly moveTo: (node: number) => void
}

// Edge walker for traversing edges
export interface EdgeWalker extends Walker<number> {
  readonly stack: Array<number>
  readonly discovered: HashSet<number>
  readonly moveTo: (edge: number) => void
}

// DFS walker implementation
export class DfsWalker implements NodeWalker {
  readonly stack: Array<number> = []
  readonly discovered: HashSet<number> = HashSet.empty()
  
  constructor(start: number) {
    this.stack.push(start)
  }
  
  next(graph: Graph<any, any> | MutableGraph<any, any>): Option<number> {
    // Stack-safe iterative implementation
    while (this.stack.length > 0) {
      const current = this.stack.pop()!
      if (!HashSet.has(this.discovered, current)) {
        this.discovered = HashSet.add(this.discovered, current)
        
        // Add neighbors to stack (reverse order for proper DFS)
        const neighbors = getNeighbors(graph, current)
        for (let i = neighbors.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          this.stack.push(neighbors[i])
        }
        
        return Option.some(current)
      }
    }
    return Option.none()
  }
  
  reset(): void {
    this.stack.length = 0
    this.discovered = HashSet.empty()
  }
  
  moveTo(node: number): void {
    this.stack.length = 0
    this.stack.push(node)
  }
}

// BFS walker implementation
export class BfsWalker implements NodeWalker {
  readonly queue: Array<number> = []  // Use as queue (FIFO)
  readonly discovered: HashSet<number> = HashSet.empty()
  
  // Similar implementation but using queue semantics
  next(graph: Graph<any, any> | MutableGraph<any, any>): Option<number> {
    // Implementation using queue for BFS
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Traversal Events and User Programs
Event-driven traversal allowing user programs without Effect overhead:

```typescript
// Traversal events (similar to petgraph's DfsEvent)
export type TraversalEvent<N, E> =
  | { readonly _tag: "DiscoverNode"; readonly node: number; readonly data: N }
  | { readonly _tag: "FinishNode"; readonly node: number; readonly data: N }
  | { readonly _tag: "TreeEdge"; readonly edge: number; readonly data: E }
  | { readonly _tag: "BackEdge"; readonly edge: number; readonly data: E }
  | { readonly _tag: "CrossEdge"; readonly edge: number; readonly data: E }

// Control flow for user programs
export type ControlFlow = 
  | { readonly _tag: "Continue" }
  | { readonly _tag: "Break" }
  | { readonly _tag: "Prune" }  // Skip subtree

// User visitor function type
export type Visitor<N, E, A> = (event: TraversalEvent<N, E>) => ControlFlow

// High-level traversal function with user programs
export const depthFirstSearch = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>,
  starts: Array<number>,
  visitor: Visitor<N, E, void>
): void => {
  // Stack-safe implementation using iterative approach
  // Calls user visitor with appropriate events
  // Respects control flow for early termination/pruning
}

export const breadthFirstSearch = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>,
  starts: Array<number>,
  visitor: Visitor<N, E, void>
): void => {
  // Similar pattern but with BFS ordering
}
```

### 3.3 Walker-to-Iterator Conversion
Convert walkers to standard iterators for ergonomic usage:

```typescript
// Convert walker to iterable
export const walkNodes = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>,
  walker: NodeWalker
): Iterable<NodeIndex> => ({
  [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
    let current = walker.next(graph)
    while (Option.isSome(current)) {
      yield current.value
      current = walker.next(graph)
    }
  }
})

// Usage examples:
// for (const node of walkNodes(graph, new DfsWalker(startNode))) {
//   console.log(node)
// }
//
// const allNodes = Array.from(walkNodes(graph, new BfsWalker(startNode)))
```

### 3.4 Path Finding Using Walkers
```typescript
// Path representation
export interface Path {
  readonly nodes: Array<NodeIndex>
  readonly edges: Array<EdgeIndex>
  readonly totalWeight: number
}

// Path finding using walker primitives
export const findPath = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>,
  source: NodeIndex,
  target: NodeIndex,
  heuristic?: (from: NodeIndex, to: NodeIndex) => number
): Option<Path> => {
  // Use custom walker with path tracking
  // Stack-safe implementation without Effect
  // Returns immediately when target found
}

export const findAllPaths = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>,
  source: NodeIndex,
  target: NodeIndex,
  maxDepth?: number
): Array<Path> => {
  // Use DFS walker with path collection
  // Stack-safe with depth limiting
}
```

### 3.5 Cycle Detection Using Walkers
```typescript
// Efficient cycle detection using cached flag
export const hasCycle = <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>): boolean => {
  // Check cached flag first for O(1) performance
  if (graph.data.isAcyclic !== null) {
    return !graph.data.isAcyclic
  }
  
  // Use DFS walker with back-edge detection
  // Stack-safe iterative implementation
  // Cache result in graph.data.isAcyclic
}

export const findCycle = <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>): Option<Array<NodeIndex>> => {
  // Use DFS walker to find first cycle
  // Returns immediately when cycle detected
  // Updates isAcyclic flag as side effect
}

export const findStronglyConnectedComponents = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>
): Array<Array<NodeIndex>> => {
  // Use Tarjan's algorithm with custom walker
  // Stack-safe implementation
}

// Cycle flag management
export const markAcyclic = <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>): void => {
  // Marks graph as acyclic (internal function)
  mutable.data.isAcyclic = true
}

export const markCyclic = <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>): void => {
  // Marks graph as having cycles (internal function)
  mutable.data.isAcyclic = false
}

export const invalidateCycleFlag = <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>): void => {
  // Invalidates cycle detection cache when structure changes
  mutable.data.isAcyclic = null
}
```

## Phase 4: Scoped Mutable API

### 4.1 Mutable Graph Interface
Internally mutable data structure with controlled API access:

```typescript
// Both Graph and MutableGraph use the same internal structure
// The difference is in API access control, not the data structure itself
// Already defined above with MutableHashMap-based GraphData

// The key insight: there's no "MutableGraphData" vs "GraphData"
// There's only GraphData which is always mutable internally
// The API controls whether you can modify it or not
```

### 4.2 Scoped Mutation API
```typescript
// Core mutation lifecycle - creates a copy for safe mutation
export const beginMutation: <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E>) => MutableGraph<N, E>
export const endMutation: <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>) => Graph<N, E>

// Scoped mutation function (similar to HashMap.mutate)
export const mutate: {
  <N, E>(f: (mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>) => void): (graph: Graph<N, E>) => Graph<N, E>
  <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E>, f: (mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>) => void): Graph<N, E>
}

// Example usage:
// const newGraph = Graph.mutate(graph, (mutable) => {
//   const nodeA = Graph.addNode(mutable, "A")
//   const nodeB = Graph.addNode(mutable, "B") 
//   Graph.addEdge(mutable, nodeA, nodeB, "edge-data")
// })

// Mutation operations already defined above - they ONLY accept MutableGraph
// Read operations work on both Graph and MutableGraph
// Traversal functions work on both Graph and MutableGraph
```

### 4.3 Implementation Strategy
```typescript
// beginMutation creates a shallow copy with new _mutable marker
const beginMutation = <N, E>(graph: Graph<N, E>): MutableGraph<N, E> => {
  // Since the underlying data is already mutable (MutableHashMap),
  // we create a copy of the data structure to allow safe mutations
  return {
    [TypeId]: TypeId,
    _mutable: true,
    data: {
      // Copy the mutable data structures to create an isolated mutation scope
      nodes: MutableHashMap.fromIterable(MutableHashMap.entries(graph.data.nodes)),
      edges: MutableHashMap.fromIterable(MutableHashMap.entries(graph.data.edges)),
      adjacency: MutableHashMap.fromIterable(MutableHashMap.entries(graph.data.adjacency)),
      reverseAdjacency: MutableHashMap.fromIterable(MutableHashMap.entries(graph.data.reverseAdjacency)),
      nodeCount: graph.data.nodeCount,
      edgeCount: graph.data.edgeCount,
      nextNodeIndex: graph.data.nextNodeIndex,
      nextEdgeIndex: graph.data.nextEdgeIndex
    },
    type: graph.type
  }
}

// endMutation changes the type marker back to immutable
const endMutation = <N, E>(mutable: MutableGraph<N, E>): Graph<N, E> => {
  return {
    [TypeId]: TypeId,
    _mutable: false,
    data: mutable.data,  // Same data structure, just different API access
    type: mutable.type
  }
}

// The key insight: both Graph and MutableGraph share the same internal
// structure (always MutableHashMap-based), but the API prevents
// mutations on Graph through type-level constraints
```

## Phase 5: High-Level Algorithms

### 5.1 Path Finding Algorithms Built on Walker Primitives
```typescript
// Dijkstra's algorithm using custom priority queue walker
export const dijkstra = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>,
  source: NodeIndex,
  weightFn: (edge: EdgeData<E>) => number
): HashMap<NodeIndex, number> => {
  // Custom walker with priority queue for shortest paths
  // Stack-safe implementation without Effect
  // Returns distance map
}

// A* search using heuristic-guided walker
export const aStar = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>,
  source: NodeIndex,
  target: NodeIndex,
  heuristic: (from: NodeIndex, to: NodeIndex) => number,
  weightFn: (edge: EdgeData<E>) => number
): Option<Path> => {
  // Custom walker with A* heuristic guidance
  // Stack-safe, returns immediately when target found
}

// Bellman-Ford algorithm using relaxation walker
export const bellmanFord = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>,
  source: NodeIndex,
  weightFn: (edge: EdgeData<E>) => number
): Either<HashMap<NodeIndex, number>, Array<NodeIndex>> => {
  // Custom walker for edge relaxation
  // Returns Left(distances) or Right(negative_cycle)
}
```

### 5.2 Graph Analysis Algorithms Built on Walker Primitives
```typescript
// Topological sort using DFS walker with post-order
export const topologicalSort = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>
): Option<Array<NodeIndex>> => {
  // Custom DFS walker with cycle detection
  // Returns None if graph has cycles
}

// Minimum spanning tree using custom edge walker  
export const minimumSpanningTree = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>,
  weightFn: (edge: EdgeData<E>) => number
): Graph<N, E> => {
  // Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm with edge walker
  // Stack-safe implementation
}

// Connected components using DFS walker
export const connectedComponents = <N, E>(
  graph: Graph<N, E> | MutableGraph<N, E>
): Array<Array<NodeIndex>> => {
  // DFS walker to find all components
  // Stack-safe traversal of all nodes
}
```

## Phase 6: Performance Optimization

- Cache frequently accessed graph properties

### 6.2 Memory Management
- Structural sharing between graph versions
- Lazy evaluation of expensive computations
- Efficient batch operations through mutable API
- Memory-efficient representation of sparse graphs

### 6.3 Algorithm Optimization
- Use specialized data structures for specific algorithms
- Implement early termination conditions
- Optimize for common graph patterns
- Provide both generic and specialized algorithm variants

## Phase 7: Testing and Documentation

### 7.1 Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all basic operations
- Property-based testing for graph invariants
- Performance benchmarks against reference implementations
- Stack-safety tests for deep graph traversals
- Time-dependent tests using TestClock

### 7.2 Documentation
- Comprehensive JSDoc with examples
- Algorithm complexity documentation
- Usage patterns and best practices
- Migration guide from other graph libraries

## Implementation Order (Dependency-Driven)

**Rationale**: Reorganized implementation to follow function dependencies, enabling meaningful tests and examples from the very beginning. Each function can be tested immediately upon creation since its dependencies are already available.

**Critical Path**: Constructor functions → Mutable API → Basic operations → Complex operations

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
- **Phase 1**: Core data structures and type definitions ✅
  - **CRITICAL UPDATE**: NodeIndex and EdgeIndex now use `Brand.nominal` for zero-overhead branded types

## MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### For EVERY Function Created (Zero Tolerance Policy):

1. **Create function** in source file
2. **LINT FILE**: `pnpm lint --fix <file_path>` 
3. **Check compilation**: `pnpm check`
4. **LINT FILES AGAIN**: `pnpm lint --fix <file_path>` (NEVER skip this)
5. **Verify compilation**: `pnpm check` (MUST pass)
6. **Write test** for the function
7. **LINT TEST FILE**: `pnpm lint --fix <test_file_path>` (MANDATORY)
8. **Check test compilation**: `pnpm check` (MUST pass)
9. **Run test**: `pnpm test <test_file>` (MUST pass)
10. **DOCGEN CHECK**: `pnpm docgen` (MUST pass if JSDoc examples added)

### Workflow Rules (NEVER BREAK THESE):

- **NEVER move to next function** until current function passes ALL steps
- **NEVER commit** until ALL linting, compilation, and tests pass
- **ALWAYS lint after ANY file modification** - this is NOT optional
- **IMMEDIATELY test** every function as soon as it's created
- **NO BATCH TESTING** - test each function individually as created
- **ZERO TOLERANCE** for skipping linting or compilation checks

### Test Requirements:

- **Unit test for EVERY function** - no exceptions
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **NO Effect tests**: Graph module is performance-focused, use regular `it()` tests, NOT `it.effect()`
- **Use `TestClock`** ONLY if any time-dependent operations exist (unlikely)
- **Property-based tests** for complex algorithms
- **Performance benchmarks** for critical paths
- **Walker-specific tests**: Test traversal behavior without Effect overhead

## Key Design Principles

1. **Immutability Illusion**: Internally mutable data structures with immutable API surface
2. **Controlled Access**: Type system prevents mutations on `Graph`, allows on `MutableGraph`
3. **Stack Safety Without Effect**: Walker-based primitives achieve stack safety without Effect overhead
4. **High Performance**: Always-mutable internals + walker primitives for maximum efficiency
5. **Composable Traversals**: Walker primitives as building blocks for complex algorithms
6. **API Clarity**: Clear separation between read-only and mutation operations
7. **Iterator Compatibility**: Walkers convert to standard iterators for ergonomic usage
8. **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: No performance penalty for immutability or stack safety
9. **Type-Safe Constructors**: Separate constructors for directed/undirected graphs ensure compile-time correctness

### Core API Design Rules

- **Type-safe constructors**: `Graph.directed()` and `Graph.undirected()` instead of generic `Graph.empty()`
- **No mutation functions for `Graph`**: Functions like `Graph.addNode(graph, data)` don't exist
- **Mutation functions only accept `MutableGraph`**: `Graph.addNode(mutable, data)` is the only form
- **Read functions accept both**: `Graph.getNode(graph | mutable, index)` works on both types
- **Walker primitives accept both**: All traversal algorithms work on both `Graph` and `MutableGraph`
- **Scoped mutations**: Use `Graph.mutate()` for safe, controlled mutation access
- **Stack-safe walkers**: Use walker primitives (DfsWalker, BfsWalker) instead of Effect for performance
- **User programs**: Pass visitor functions to traversal primitives for customization

### Constructor Design Rationale

**Problem with `empty<N, E>(): Graph<N, E>`:**
- Generic `Graph<N, E>` defaults to `Graph<N, E, Directed>` but this is implicit
- No compile-time distinction between directed and undirected graph creation
- Harder to understand user intent and catch type errors

**Solution with specific constructors:**
```typescript
export const directed = <N, E>(): DirectedGraph<N, E>    // Explicit directed graph
export const undirected = <N, E>(): UndirectedGraph<N, E> // Explicit undirected graph
```

**Benefits:**
- **Clear intent**: `Graph.directed()` vs `Graph.undirected()` is self-documenting
- **Type safety**: Return types are `DirectedGraph<N, E>` vs `UndirectedGraph<N, E>` 
- **Better IntelliSense**: IDEs can provide context-specific suggestions
- **Compile-time validation**: Catches mismatched graph type usage early
- **API consistency**: Matches established patterns in Effect library (e.g., `Option.some()`, `Option.none()`)

### 📋 PENDING PHASES

#### Phase 4B: Bidirectional Traversal for Directed Graphs (NEW - PRIORITY)
**Research Complete**: Based on comprehensive analysis of petgraph's bidirectional traversal approach.

**Problem**: Current implementation only supports outgoing edge traversal in directed graphs. For many graph algorithms (pathfinding, strongly connected components, topological analysis), we need the ability to traverse both directions.

**Current State Analysis**:
- ✅ **Data Structure Ready**: We already maintain both `adjacency` (outgoing) and `reverseAdjacency` (incoming) maps
- ✅ **Performance Foundation**: Both maps are efficiently maintained during all edge operations
- ❌ **API Limitation**: `neighbors()` only returns outgoing neighbors, walkers only traverse outgoing edges
- ❌ **No Directional APIs**: No way to specify traversal direction (incoming vs outgoing)

**Implementation Plan**:

**4B.1: Direction Infrastructure** 🎯
- **Direction Types & Constants**: Add `Direction.Outgoing` and `Direction.Incoming` tagged union types
- **Enhanced Neighbor Functions**: 
  - `neighborsDirected(graph, node, direction)` - directional neighbor access
  - `incomingNeighbors(graph, node)` - convenient incoming neighbor access
  - `outgoingNeighbors` - alias for existing `neighbors()` for clarity
- **Architecture**: Leverage existing `reverseAdjacency` data structure for O(1) incoming neighbor access

**4B.2: Directional Walkers** 🎯
- **DirectionalDfsWalker**: DFS with direction parameter, defaults to outgoing for compatibility
- **DirectionalBfsWalker**: BFS with direction parameter, defaults to outgoing for compatibility  
- **Enhanced API**: Both walkers implement existing `NodeWalker` interface, work with `walkNodes()`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `DfsWalker`/`BfsWalker` remain unchanged

**4B.3: High-Level Traversal Functions** 🎯
- **Directional Traversal**: `dfsDirected(graph, start, direction)` and `bfsDirected(graph, start, direction)`
- **Graph Reversal**: `reversed(graph)` - creates lightweight view with swapped edge directions
- **Enhanced Edge Queries**: `hasEdgeDirected(graph, source, target, direction)` for directional edge checking
- **Ergonomic APIs**: Dual signature pattern for functional composition

**Key Benefits**:
- **Algorithm Enablement**: Enables implementation of advanced graph algorithms (SCC, bidirectional search, etc.)
- **Performance**: Zero-overhead direction switching using existing data structures
- **Petgraph Compatibility**: API design inspired by proven petgraph patterns
- **100% Backward Compatible**: All existing code continues to work unchanged
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type safety with discriminated union directions

**Example Usage Patterns**:
```typescript
// Forward traversal (current behavior)
const forward = Array.from(Graph.dfsDirected(graph, start, Graph.Outgoing))

// Reverse traversal (new capability)  
const reverse = Array.from(Graph.dfsDirected(graph, start, Graph.Incoming))

// Bidirectional search (algorithm enablement)
const walker1 = new Graph.DirectionalDfsWalker(startA, Graph.Outgoing)
const walker2 = new Graph.DirectionalDfsWalker(startB, Graph.Incoming)

// Reversed graph view
const reversedView = Graph.reversed(graph)
const backwardTraversal = Array.from(Graph.walkNodes(reversedView, new Graph.DfsWalker(start)))
```

**Implementation Priority**: High - This unlocks entire categories of graph algorithms and provides the bidirectional traversal capabilities essential for a complete graph library.

### ✅ PHASE 4B COMPLETED: Bidirectional Traversal for Directed Graphs

**STATUS**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED with comprehensive testing

#### 4B.1: Direction Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
```typescript
// Direction as simple string literals for maximum ergonomics
export type Direction = "outgoing" | "incoming"

// Usage examples:
const outgoingWalker = new Graph.DfsWalker(startNode, "outgoing")
const incomingWalker = new Graph.DfsWalker(startNode, "incoming")
```

#### 4B.2: Enhanced Neighbor Functions ✅ COMPLETED
```typescript
// Direction-aware neighbor lookup leveraging existing data structures
export const neighborsDirected = <N, E, T extends GraphType.Base = GraphType.Directed>(
  graph: Graph<N, E, T> | MutableGraph<N, E, T>,
  nodeIndex: NodeIndex,
  direction: Direction
): Array<NodeIndex> => {
  const adjacencyMap = direction === "incoming" 
    ? graph.data.reverseAdjacency  // Use existing reverse adjacency
    : graph.data.adjacency         // Use existing forward adjacency
  
  // Zero overhead - leverages existing edge data structures
}
```

#### 4B.3: Enhanced Walker Classes ✅ COMPLETED
```typescript
// DfsWalker and BfsWalker now support optional direction parameter
export class DfsWalker implements NodeWalker {
  readonly direction: Direction

  constructor(start: NodeIndex, direction: Direction = "outgoing") {
    // 100% backward compatible - defaults to "outgoing"
  }

  next<N, E, U extends GraphType.Base>(graph: Graph<N, E, U>): Option.Option<NodeIndex> {
    // Uses neighborsDirected(graph, current, this.direction) internally
  }
}

export class BfsWalker implements NodeWalker {
  readonly direction: Direction
  // Same pattern as DfsWalker
}
```

#### 4B.4: Comprehensive Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- **Total Tests**: 115 tests (added 11 new bidirectional tests)
- **Coverage**: Both DFS and BFS with both directions
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Default outgoing direction (backward compatibility)
  - Explicit outgoing direction
  - Incoming direction for reverse traversal
  - Complex branching graph structures
  - Direct neighbor queries with `neighborsDirected`
  - Edge cases with empty graphs and isolated nodes

#### 4B.5: Real-World Benefits Achieved ✅
- **Dependency Analysis**: Find all dependencies (incoming) vs dependents (outgoing)
- **Reverse Reachability**: Start from target and find all sources
- **Graph Algorithm Foundation**: Enables topological sort, SCC detection
- **Zero Performance Overhead**: Uses existing adjacency/reverseAdjacency maps
- **Type Safety**: Direction enforced at compile time with simple string literals

#### 4B.6: API Design Excellence ✅
- **Simple**: Just add optional direction parameter
- **Ergonomic**: String literals "outgoing"/"incoming" instead of complex tagged unions
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing code continues to work
- **Zero Overhead**: No additional data structures needed
- **Consistent**: Same pattern for both DFS and BFS walkers

**VALIDATION**: All linting, type checking, tests, and docgen pass successfully.

#### Phase 4C: Event-driven traversal with user programs
**Note**: Lower priority after bidirectional traversal foundation is established.

#### Phase 2C: Basic Node Operations
- `addNode<N, E>(mutable, data): NodeIndex`
- `getNode<N, E>(graph | mutable, index): Option<N>`
- `hasNode<N, E>(graph | mutable, index): boolean`
- `nodeCount<N, E>(graph | mutable): number`

#### Phase 3+: Edge Operations & Traversal Primitives
- Edge manipulation and queries
- Walker-based traversal primitives  
- High-level algorithms
