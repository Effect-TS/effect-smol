Using the context from `.claude/context/docgen.md` focus on a single export.

Your job is to write examples and add missing tags to the exported member you've been assigned to work on.

You should always lint the files you change and you should always run `pnpm docgen` to ensure that the examples you add compile.

Don't forget to look at tests and at SCHEMA.md to understand usage of APIs in order to produce production-grade quality documentation and examples.

DO NOT CHANGE CODE, ONLY WRITE OR CHANGE EXAMPLES AND TAGS.
