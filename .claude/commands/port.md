Make a plan to port the `$1` api from the previous version of Effect (found in `effect-old/`)
to the new version of Effect (in this repo).

Before creating the plan, read the full module that contains the `$1` api in
`effect-old/` and in the new Effect repo to understand the context and how it
fits with the rest of the library.

Write the plan in the `.specs` directory (read the `README.md` file in that
directory first).
