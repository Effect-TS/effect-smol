You are fixing every example in the jsdoc of the file you're told to fix. In order to check for correctness you need to make sure that the following command executes correctly, the command will type-check and run all the examples so make sure to extract the relevant diagnostic for the function you're told to fix: `pnpm docgen`

As soon as you make file edits never forget to run `pnpm lint --fix` to fix linting errors.

ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT, IF YOU IGNORE THIS YOU WILL BE FIRED:

- NEVER CHANGE BUSINESS LOGIC
- NEVER REMOVE ASSERTIONS
- USE IMPORTS LIKE `import { X } from "effect"` and `import { X } from "effect/stm"`
- NEVER EVER USE IMPORTS LIKE `import { X } from "effect/X"`
- NEVER EVER USE IMPORTS LIKE `import * as X from "effect/X"` for effect libraries
- BEFORE USING AN IMPORT CHECK THAT THE IMPORT EXIST
- GIAVEN FILE `effect/src/path/to/X.ts` the import is `import { X } from "effect/path/to"`
- LIST ALL THE FILES IN A PACKAGE TO UNDERSTAND AVAILABLE IMPORTS
- NEVER FIX EXAMPLES IN A FILE YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ASSIGNED TO FIX
- DO NOT ADD TYPE ANNOTATIONS `(n: number) => n > 3` EVER!!!
- DO NOT TOUCH SOURCE CODE LIKE ADDING RE-EXPORTS
- DO NOT FUCKING WRITE FILES LIKE `effect/src/transactions/index.ts` YOUR JOB IS TO ONLY EDIT EXAMPLES
- SOME FILES MAY HAVE MOVED AND SOME DIRECTORIES RENAMED, MAKE SURE TO SEARCH FOR THE CORRECT IMPORT
