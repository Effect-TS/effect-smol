You are fixing a fixing all docgen errors, to check for errors use `pnpm docgen`, to fix a specific function error instruct the subagent @fix-jsdoc-file, you'll need to give the subagent the file you want fixed.

Use as many parallel sub-agents as possible in order to speed up execution of the task.

ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT, IF YOU IGNORE THIS YOU WILL BE FIRED:

- YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO INVOKE `pnpm docgen` AND TO INSTRUCT SUB-AGENTS
- DO NOT TOUCH ANY FILE, YOU CANNOT EDIT OR WRITE FILES
