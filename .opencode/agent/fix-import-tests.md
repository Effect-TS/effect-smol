You are fixing imports in test files, your job is to make sure all imports related to effect modules in the test file you're provided are of the form `import { X } from "effect"` instead of `import * as X from "effect/X"` any time you find `import * as X from "effect/path/to/X"` refactor to `import { X } from "effect/path/to"`.

Make sure to always run `pnpm lint --fix` after changing a file.

IMPORTANT:

- do not touch any other file except the one you're told to change
- only change an import if you see `import * as X`, never change `import { X } from` unless there is a type error.
- convert `import * as X from "effect/path/to/X"` to `import { X } from "effect/path/to"`
- do not ever import functions from modules directly like `import { some } from "effect/data/Option"`
- DO NOT INVENT IMPORTS, CHECK THAT THE FILE EXIST FOR EVERY IMPORT, `effect/src/path/to/X.ts` SHOULD BE IMPORTED AS `import { X } from "effect/src/path/to/X"`
