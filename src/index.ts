 * This is useful when you want to distinguish between two values of the same type that have different meanings.
 * The `nominal` function does not perform any validation of the input data.
 *
 * On the other hand, the `refined` function is used to create a new branded type that has the same underlying type as the input,
 * but with a different name, and it also allows for validation of the input data.
 * The `refined` function takes a predicate that is used to validate the input data.
 * If the input data fails the validation, a `BrandErrors` is returned, which provides information about the specific validation failure.
