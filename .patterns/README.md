# Effect Library Development Patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE
This directory provides reusable solutions and best practices for Effect TypeScript development, ensuring consistency and quality across the Effect library codebase.

## ðŸ“š AVAILABLE PATTERNS

### Core Development Patterns
- **[effect-library-development.md](./effect-library-development.md)** - Fundamental patterns for Effect library development
- **[module-organization.md](./module-organization.md)** - Module structure, exports, and naming conventions
- **[error-handling.md](./error-handling.md)** - Structured error management with Effect

### Documentation Patterns
- **[jsdoc-documentation.md](./jsdoc-documentation.md)** - JSDoc documentation standards and examples

### Testing Patterns
- **[testing-patterns.md](./testing-patterns.md)** - Testing strategies with @effect/vitest and TestClock

### Architecture Patterns
- **[platform-integration.md](./platform-integration.md)** - Service abstractions and cross-platform patterns

## ðŸ”§ HOW TO USE

### For Developers
1. **Reference before implementing** - Check relevant patterns before starting new work
2. **Follow established conventions** - Use patterns as templates for consistency
3. **Contribute improvements** - Update patterns based on lessons learned

### For Code Reviews
1. **Validate pattern compliance** - Ensure implementations follow established patterns
2. **Identify pattern violations** - Look for anti-patterns and forbidden practices
3. **Suggest pattern usage** - Recommend appropriate patterns for specific use cases

### For Documentation
1. **Extract reusable patterns** - Identify common solutions for documentation
2. **Update patterns** - Keep patterns current with library evolution
3. **Cross-reference examples** - Link patterns to real codebase examples

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### Forbidden Patterns (NEVER USE)
- **try-catch in Effect.gen**: Breaks Effect's error handling semantics
- **Type assertions**: `as any`, `as never`, `as unknown` hide type errors
- **Unsafe patterns**: Any pattern that bypasses Effect's type safety

### Mandatory Patterns (ALWAYS USE)
- **return yield* for errors**: Makes termination explicit in generators
- **Immediate linting**: `pnpm lint --fix` after editing TypeScript files
- **JSDoc compilation validation**: `pnpm docgen` must pass
- **Effect testing patterns**: Use @effect/vitest with `it.effect`
- **TestClock for time**: Use TestClock for any time-dependent operations

## ðŸ“ˆ PATTERN QUALITY METRICS

### Completeness
- [ ] Core concepts clearly explained
- [ ] Executable code examples provided
- [ ] Common use cases covered
- [ ] Integration patterns documented

### Accuracy
- [ ] All examples compile and run correctly
- [ ] Patterns follow current Effect library conventions
- [ ] No deprecated or anti-pattern usage
- [ ] Proper error handling demonstrated

### Clarity
- [ ] Clear explanations for "why" not just "how"
- [ ] Progressive complexity (simple to advanced examples)
- [ ] Common pitfalls identified and explained
- [ ] Best practices highlighted

## ðŸ”„ MAINTENANCE

### Regular Updates
- **API Changes**: Update patterns when Effect library APIs evolve
- **New Patterns**: Add patterns for newly identified common use cases
- **Deprecation**: Mark outdated patterns and provide migration paths
- **Examples**: Keep examples current with latest library versions

### Quality Assurance
- **Pattern Validation**: Regularly test all code examples
- **Consistency**: Ensure patterns align with current codebase standards
- **Documentation**: Keep pattern documentation synchronized with implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS INDICATORS

### Developer Experience
- Reduced time to implement common patterns
- Consistent code quality across the codebase
- Fewer pattern-related code review comments
- Improved onboarding for new contributors

### Code Quality
- Consistent architecture patterns throughout codebase
- Proper error handling and resource management
- Type-safe implementations without workarounds
- Comprehensive test coverage with proper patterns

### Documentation Quality
- Practical, working examples for all patterns
- Clear guidance on when and how to use each pattern
- Integration examples showing pattern composition
- Anti-pattern identification and alternatives

This patterns directory serves as the authoritative guide for Effect library development, ensuring consistent, high-quality implementations across the entire codebase.
