# Spec-Driven Development Flow & .claude/commands Integration

## Implementation Plan

### Overview
Integrate rigorous 5-phase spec-driven development workflow and .claude/commands from https://github.com/mikearnaldi/http-api-todos into the Effect library codebase.

### Phase 1: Directory Structure Setup ✅
- [x] Create feature branch: `feature/spec-driven-development-integration`
- [x] Create `.claude/commands/` directory structure
- [x] Create `.specs/spec-driven-development-integration/` directory
- [x] Create `.specs/README.md` with feature tracking and workflow documentation

### Phase 2: Core Commands Implementation ✅
- [x] `new-feature.md` - 5-phase spec-driven workflow adapted for Effect
- [x] `done-feature.md` - Completion workflow with Effect-specific checks

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration Points
- [ ] Development quality gates with mandatory checks
- [ ] Git integration with spec tracking
- [ ] PR creation with spec completion validation

### Phase 4: Patterns Documentation ✅
- [x] Create `.patterns/` directory (hidden directory)
- [x] `.patterns/README.md` - Overview and organization
- [x] `.patterns/effect-library-development.md` - Core Effect patterns
- [x] `.patterns/testing-patterns.md` - Testing with @effect/vitest and TestClock
- [x] `.patterns/module-organization.md` - Module structure and naming conventions
- [x] `.patterns/error-handling.md` - Structured error management patterns
- [x] `.patterns/jsdoc-documentation.md` - Documentation standards and examples
- [x] `.patterns/platform-integration.md` - Service abstractions and cross-platform patterns

### Phase 5: Command Customizations for Effect Library

#### Effect-Specific Validation Steps
- **JSDoc Compilation**: `pnpm docgen` validation in all workflows
- **TypeScript Linting**: Immediate linting after any .ts file edit
- **Testing Patterns**: Integration with @effect/vitest and it.effect
- **Type Safety**: Zero tolerance enforcement for `any`/type assertions
- **Effect Patterns**: Generator function and error handling validation

#### Workflow Enhancements
- **Documentation Integration**: Link specs to JSDoc progress tracking
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure TestClock usage for time-dependent tests
- **Quality Metrics**: Track JSDoc coverage improvements
- **Pattern Compliance**: Validate against Effect library conventions

### Phase 6: Implementation Benefits

#### For Effect Library Development
- **Systematic Feature Development**: Structured approach to complex features
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple validation checkpoints
- **Documentation Coverage**: Integrated JSDoc enhancement workflow
- **Pattern Consistency**: Standardized architectural approaches
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Optimized for Claude/AI interaction

#### Integration with Existing Workflow
- **Maintains Current Standards**: Builds on existing CLAUDE.md requirements
- **Enhances Quality Gates**: Adds specification-driven validation
- **Improves Planning**: Structured approach to complex features
- **Documentation Focus**: Systematic JSDoc coverage improvement

### Implementation Progress Tracking
- [x] Phase 1: Directory Setup
- [x] Phase 2: Core Commands
- [ ] Phase 3: Workflow Integration
- [x] Phase 4: Patterns Documentation
- [x] Phase 5: Effect Customizations (integrated into commands)
- [ ] Phase 6: Testing & Validation

### Success Criteria
- All commands functional and Effect-specific
- Integration with existing CLAUDE.md requirements
- Documented patterns for Effect development
- Validated workflow with pilot feature
- Zero breaking changes to existing processes

### Critical Requirements
- **NEVER use try-catch in Effect.gen generators**
- **NEVER use type assertions (as any, as never, as unknown)**
- **ALWAYS use return yield* for errors/interrupts in Effect.gen**
- **ALWAYS run pnpm lint --fix after editing TypeScript files**
- **ALWAYS validate JSDoc examples with pnpm docgen**
- **ALWAYS use @effect/vitest and TestClock for time-dependent tests**
