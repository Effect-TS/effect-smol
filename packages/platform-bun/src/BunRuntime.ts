/**
 * Helps you run a main effect with built-in error handling, logging, and signal management.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * This function launches an Effect as the main entry point, setting exit codes
 * based on success or failure, handling interrupts (e.g., Ctrl+C), and optionally
 * logging errors. By default, it logs errors and uses a "pretty" format, but both
 * behaviors can be turned off. You can also provide custom teardown logic to
 * finalize resources or produce different exit codes.
 *
 * **Options**
 *
 * An optional object that can include:
 * - `disableErrorReporting`: Turn off automatic error logging.
 * - `disablePrettyLogger`: Avoid adding the pretty logger.
 * - `teardown`: Provide custom finalization logic.
 *
 * **When to Use**
 *
 * Use this function to run an Effect as your application’s main program, especially
 * when you need structured error handling, log management, interrupt support,
 * or advanced teardown capabilities.
