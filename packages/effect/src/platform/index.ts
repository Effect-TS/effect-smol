/**
 * This module provides a comprehensive file system abstraction that supports both synchronous
 * and asynchronous file operations through Effect. It includes utilities for file I/O, directory
 * management, permissions, timestamps, and file watching with proper error handling.
 *
 * The `FileSystem` interface provides a cross-platform abstraction over file system operations,
 * allowing you to work with files and directories in a functional, composable way. All operations
 * return `Effect` values that can be composed, transformed, and executed safely.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { FileSystem, Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const fs = yield* FileSystem.FileSystem
 *
 *   // Create a directory
 *   yield* fs.makeDirectory("./temp", { recursive: true })
 *
 *   // Write a file
 *   yield* fs.writeFileString("./temp/hello.txt", "Hello, World!")
 *
 *   // Read the file back
 *   const content = yield* fs.readFileString("./temp/hello.txt")
 *   yield* Console.log("File content:", content)
 *
 *   // Get file information
 *   const stats = yield* fs.stat("./temp/hello.txt")
 *   yield* Console.log("File size:", stats.size)
 *
 *   // Clean up
 *   yield* fs.remove("./temp", { recursive: true })
 * })
 * ```
