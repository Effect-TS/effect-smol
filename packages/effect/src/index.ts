/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Cause`, a data type that represents
 * the different ways an `Effect` can fail. It includes structured error handling with
 * typed errors, defects, and interruptions.
 *
 * A `Cause` can represent:
 * - **Fail**: A typed, expected error that can be handled
 * - **Die**: An unrecoverable defect (like a programming error)
 * - **Interrupt**: A fiber interruption
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Cause, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Creating different types of causes
 * const failCause = Cause.fail("Something went wrong")
 * const dieCause = Cause.die(new Error("Unexpected error"))
 * const interruptCause = Cause.interrupt(123)
 *
 * // Working with effects that can fail
 * const program = Effect.fail("user error").pipe(
 *   Effect.catchCause((cause) => {
 *     if (Cause.hasFail(cause)) {
 *       const error = Cause.filterError(cause)
 *       console.log("Expected error:", error)
 *     }
 *     return Effect.succeed("handled")
 *   })
 * )
 *
 * // Analyzing failure types
 * const analyzeCause = (cause: Cause.Cause<string>) => {
 *   if (Cause.hasFail(cause)) return "Has user error"
 *   if (Cause.hasDie(cause)) return "Has defect"
 *   if (Cause.hasInterrupt(cause)) return "Was interrupted"
 *   return "Unknown cause"
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * The `Effect` module is the core of the Effect library, providing a powerful and expressive
 * way to model and compose asynchronous, concurrent, and effectful computations.
 *
 * An `Effect<A, E, R>` represents a computation that:
 * - May succeed with a value of type `A`
 * - May fail with an error of type `E`
 * - Requires a context/environment of type `R`
 *
 * Effects are lazy and immutable - they describe computations that can be executed later.
 * This allows for powerful composition, error handling, resource management, and concurrency
 * patterns.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Type-safe error handling**: Errors are tracked in the type system
 * - **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup with scoped resources
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Safe parallel and concurrent execution
 * - **Composable**: Effects can be combined using operators like `flatMap`, `map`, `zip`
 * - **Testable**: Built-in support for testing with controlled environments
 * - **Interruptible**: Effects can be safely interrupted and cancelled
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Console } from "effect/logging"
 *
 * // Creating a simple effect
 * const hello = Effect.succeed("Hello, World!")
 *
 * // Composing effects
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const message = yield* hello
 *   yield* Console.log(message)
 *   return message.length
 * })
 *
 * // Running the effect
 * Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log) // 13
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Effect that may fail
 * const divide = (a: number, b: number) =>
 *   b === 0
 *     ? Effect.fail(new Error("Division by zero"))
 *     : Effect.succeed(a / b)
 *
 * // Error handling
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const result = yield* divide(10, 2)
 *   console.log("Result:", result) // Result: 5
 *   return result
 * })
 *
 * // Handle errors
 * const safeProgram = program.pipe(
 *   Effect.match({
 *     onFailure: (error) => -1,
 *     onSuccess: (value) => value
 *   })
 * )
 * ```

/**
 * The `Exit` type represents the result of running an Effect computation.
 * An `Exit<A, E>` can either be:
 * - `Success`: Contains a value of type `A`
 * - `Failure`: Contains a `Cause<E>` describing why the effect failed
 *
 * `Exit` is used internally by the Effect runtime and can be useful for
 * handling the results of Effect computations in a more explicit way.
