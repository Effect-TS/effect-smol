 * - May fail with an error of type `E`
 * - Requires a context/environment of type `R`
 *
 * Effects are lazy and immutable - they describe computations that can be executed later.
 * This allows for powerful composition, error handling, resource management, and concurrency
 * patterns.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Type-safe error handling**: Errors are tracked in the type system
 * - **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup with scoped resources
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Safe parallel and concurrent execution
 * - **Composable**: Effects can be combined using operators like `flatMap`, `map`, `zip`
 * - **Testable**: Built-in support for testing with controlled environments
 * - **Interruptible**: Effects can be safely interrupted and cancelled
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Console } from "effect"

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Fiber`, the fundamental unit of

 * Key characteristics of Fibers:
 * - **Lightweight**: Much lighter than OS threads, you can create millions
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Parent fibers manage child fiber lifecycles
 * - **Cancellation safety**: Proper resource cleanup when interrupted
 * - **Cooperative**: Fibers yield control at effect boundaries
 * - **Traceable**: Each fiber has an ID for debugging and monitoring
 *
 * Common patterns:
 * - **Fork and join**: Start concurrent work and wait for results
 * - **Race conditions**: Run multiple effects, take the first to complete
 * - **Supervision**: Monitor and restart failed fibers
 * - **Resource management**: Ensure proper cleanup on interruption
 *

 * The `LogLevel` module provides utilities for managing log levels in Effect applications.
 * It defines a hierarchy of log levels and provides functions for comparing and filtering logs
 * based on their severity.
 *
 * ## Log Level Hierarchy
 *
 * The log levels are ordered from most severe to least severe:
 *
 * 1. **All** - Special level that allows all messages
 * 2. **Fatal** - System is unusable, immediate attention required
 * 3. **Error** - Error conditions that should be investigated
 * 4. **Warn** - Warning conditions that may indicate problems
 * 5. **Info** - Informational messages about normal operation
 * 6. **Debug** - Debug information useful during development
 * 7. **Trace** - Very detailed trace information
 * 8. **None** - Special level that suppresses all messages
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Basic log level usage
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   yield* Effect.logFatal("System is shutting down")
 *   yield* Effect.logError("Database connection failed")
 *   yield* Effect.logWarning("Memory usage is high")
 *   yield* Effect.logInfo("User logged in")
 *   yield* Effect.logDebug("Processing request")
 *   yield* Effect.logTrace("Variable value: xyz")
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Level Comparison
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { LogLevel } from "effect"
 *
 * // Check if one level is more severe than another
 * console.log(LogLevel.greaterThan("Error", "Info")) // true
 * console.log(LogLevel.greaterThan("Debug", "Error")) // false
 *
 * // Check if level meets minimum threshold
 * console.log(LogLevel.greaterThanOrEqualTo("Info", "Debug")) // true
 * console.log(LogLevel.lessThan("Trace", "Info")) // true
 * ```
 *
 * ## Filtering by Level
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Logger, LogLevel } from "effect"
 *
 * // Create a logger that only logs Error and above
 * const errorLogger = Logger.make((options) => {
 *   if (LogLevel.greaterThanOrEqualTo(options.logLevel, "Error")) {
 *     console.log(`[${options.logLevel}] ${options.message}`)
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * // Production logger - Info and above
 * const productionLogger = Logger.make((options) => {
 *   if (LogLevel.greaterThanOrEqualTo(options.logLevel, "Info")) {
 *     console.log(
 *       `${options.date.toISOString()} [${options.logLevel}] ${options.message}`
 *     )
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * // Development logger - Debug and above
 * const devLogger = Logger.make((options) => {
 *   if (LogLevel.greaterThanOrEqualTo(options.logLevel, "Debug")) {
 *     console.log(`[${options.logLevel}] ${options.message}`)
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Runtime Configuration
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Config, Effect, Logger, LogLevel } from "effect"
 *
 * // Configure log level from environment
 * const logLevelConfig = Config.string("LOG_LEVEL").pipe(
 *   Config.withDefault("Info")
 * )

 * while enforcing exhaustiveness checking to ensure all cases are handled.
 *
 * Although pattern matching is not yet a native JavaScript feature,

 *
 * **How Pattern Matching Works**
 *
 * Pattern matching follows a structured process:
 *
 * - **Creating a matcher**: Define a `Matcher` that operates on either a
 *   specific `Match.type` or `Match.value`.
 *
 * - **Defining patterns**: Use combinators such as `Match.when`, `Match.not`,
 *   and `Match.tag` to specify matching conditions.
 *
 * - **Completing the match**: Apply a finalizer such as `Match.exhaustive`,
 *   `Match.orElse`, or `Match.option` to determine how unmatched cases should
 *   be handled.

 * Tracks cumulative values that only increase or can be reset to zero.
 * Perfect for counting events, requests, errors, etc.
 *
 * ### Gauge
 * Represents a single numerical value that can go up or down.
 * Ideal for current resource usage, temperature, queue sizes, etc.
 *
 * ### Frequency
 * Counts occurrences of discrete string values.
 * Useful for tracking categorical data like HTTP status codes, user actions, etc.
 *
 * ### Histogram
 * Records observations in configurable buckets to analyze distribution.
 * Great for response times, request sizes, and other measured values.
 *
 * ### Summary
 * Calculates quantiles over a sliding time window.
 * Provides statistical insights into value distributions over time.
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Metric } from "effect"
 *
 * // Create metrics
 * const requestCount = Metric.counter("http_requests_total", {
 *   description: "Total number of HTTP requests"
 * })
 *
 * const responseTime = Metric.histogram("http_response_time", {
 *   description: "HTTP response time in milliseconds",
 *   boundaries: Metric.linearBoundaries({ start: 0, width: 50, count: 20 })
 * })
 *
 * // Use metrics in your application
 * const handleRequest = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   yield* Metric.update(requestCount, 1)
 *
 *   const startTime = yield* Effect.clockWith((clock) => clock.currentTimeMillis)
 *
 *   // Process request...
 *   yield* Effect.sleep("100 millis")
 *
 *   const endTime = yield* Effect.clockWith((clock) => clock.currentTimeMillis)
 *   yield* Metric.update(responseTime, endTime - startTime)
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Attributes and Tagging
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Metric } from "effect"
 *
 * const requestCount = Metric.counter("requests", {
 *   description: "Number of requests by endpoint and method"
 * })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   // Add attributes to metrics
 *   yield* Metric.update(
 *     Metric.withAttributes(requestCount, {
 *       endpoint: "/api/users",
 *       method: "GET"
 *     }),
 *     1
 *   )
 *
 *   // Or use withAttributes for compile-time attributes
 *   const taggedCounter = Metric.withAttributes(requestCount, {
 *     endpoint: "/api/posts",
 *     method: "POST"
 *   })
 *   yield* Metric.update(taggedCounter, 1)
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Advanced Examples
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Metric } from "effect"
 *
 * // Business metrics
 * const userSignups = Metric.counter("user_signups_total")
 * const activeUsers = Metric.gauge("active_users_current")
 * const featureUsage = Metric.frequency("feature_usage")
 *
 * // Performance metrics
 * const dbQueryTime = Metric.summary("db_query_duration", {
 *   maxAge: "5 minutes",
 *   maxSize: 1000,
 *   quantiles: [0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99]
 * })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   // Track user signup
 *   yield* Metric.update(userSignups, 1)
 *
 *   // Update active user count
 *   yield* Metric.update(activeUsers, 1250)
 *
 *   // Record feature usage
 *   yield* Metric.update(featureUsage, "dashboard_view")
 *
 *   // Measure database query time
 *   yield* Effect.timed(performDatabaseQuery).pipe(
 *     Effect.tap(([duration]) => Metric.update(dbQueryTime, duration))
 *   )
 * })
 *
 * // Get metric snapshots
 * const getMetrics = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const snapshots = yield* Metric.snapshot
 *
 *   for (const metric of snapshots) {
 *     console.log(`${metric.id}: ${JSON.stringify(metric.state)}`)
 *   }
 * })
 * ```

/**
 * @fileoverview
 * MutableRef provides a mutable reference container that allows safe mutation of values
 * in functional programming contexts. It serves as a bridge between functional and imperative
 * programming paradigms, offering atomic operations for state management.
 *
 * Unlike regular variables, MutableRef encapsulates mutable state and provides controlled
 * access through a standardized API. It supports atomic compare-and-set operations for
 * thread-safe updates and integrates seamlessly with Effect's ecosystem.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Mutable reference semantics with functional API
 * - Atomic compare-and-set operations for safe concurrent updates
 * - Specialized operations for numeric and boolean values
 * - Chainable operations that return the reference or the value
 * - Integration with Effect's Equal interface for value comparison
 *
 * Common Use Cases:
 * - State containers in functional applications
 * - Counters and accumulators
 * - Configuration that needs to be updated at runtime
 * - Caching and memoization scenarios
 * - Inter-module communication via shared references
 *
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Get/Set: O(1)
 * - Compare-and-set: O(1)
 * - All operations: O(1)
