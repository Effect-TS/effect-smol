 * The `nominal` function does not perform any validation of the input data.
 *
 * On the other hand, the `refined` function is used to create a new branded type that has the same underlying type as the input,

 * - **Interrupt**: A fiber interruption
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts

/**
 * The `Channel` module provides a powerful abstraction for bi-directional communication
 * and streaming operations. A `Channel` is a nexus of I/O operations that supports both
 * reading and writing, forming the foundation for Effect's Stream and Sink abstractions.
 *
 * ## What is a Channel?
 *
 * A `Channel<OutElem, OutErr, OutDone, InElem, InErr, InDone, Env>` represents:
 * - **OutElem**: The type of elements the channel outputs
 * - **OutErr**: The type of errors the channel can produce
 * - **OutDone**: The type of the final value when the channel completes
 * - **InElem**: The type of elements the channel reads
 * - **InErr**: The type of errors the channel can receive
 * - **InDone**: The type of the final value from upstream
 * - **Env**: The environment/context required by the channel
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Bi-directional**: Channels can both read and write
 * - **Composable**: Channels can be piped, sequenced, and concatenated
 * - **Resource-safe**: Automatic cleanup and resource management
 * - **Error-handling**: Built-in error propagation and handling
 * - **Concurrent**: Support for concurrent operations
 *
 * ## Composition Patterns
 *
 * 1. **Piping**: Connect channels where output of one becomes input of another
 * 2. **Sequencing**: Use the result of one channel to create another
 * 3. **Concatenating**: Combine multiple channels into a single channel
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Channel, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Simple channel that outputs numbers
 * const numberChannel = Channel.succeed(42)
 *
 * // Transform channel that doubles values
 * const doubleChannel = Channel.map(numberChannel, (n) => n * 2)
 *
 * // Running the channel would output: 84
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Channel, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Channel from an array of values
 * const arrayChannel = Channel.fromArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
 *
 * // Transform the channel by mapping over values
 * const transformedChannel = Channel.map(arrayChannel, (n) => n * 2)

/**
 * The `Chunk` module provides an immutable, high-performance sequence data structure
 * optimized for functional programming patterns. A `Chunk` is a persistent data structure
 * that supports efficient append, prepend, and concatenation operations.
 *
 * ## What is a Chunk?
 *
 * A `Chunk<A>` is an immutable sequence of elements of type `A` that provides:
 * - **O(1) append and prepend operations**
 * - **Efficient concatenation** through tree-like structure
 * - **Memory efficiency** with structural sharing
 * - **Rich API** with functional programming operations
 * - **Type safety** with full TypeScript integration
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Immutable**: All operations return new chunks without modifying the original
 * - **Efficient**: Optimized data structure with logarithmic complexity for most operations
 * - **Functional**: Rich set of transformation and combination operators
 * - **Lazy evaluation**: Many operations are deferred until needed
 * - **Interoperable**: Easy conversion to/from arrays and other collections
 *
 * ## Performance Characteristics
 *
 * - **Append/Prepend**: O(1) amortized
 * - **Random Access**: O(log n)
 * - **Concatenation**: O(log min(m, n))
 * - **Iteration**: O(n)
 * - **Memory**: Structural sharing minimizes allocation
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Chunk } from "effect"
 *
 * // Creating chunks
 * const chunk1 = Chunk.fromIterable([1, 2, 3])
 * const chunk2 = Chunk.fromIterable([4, 5, 6])
 * const empty = Chunk.empty<number>()
 *
 * // Combining chunks
 * const combined = Chunk.appendAll(chunk1, chunk2)
 * console.log(Chunk.toReadonlyArray(combined)) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Chunk } from "effect"
 *
 * // Functional transformations
 * const numbers = Chunk.range(1, 5) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * const doubled = Chunk.map(numbers, (n) => n * 2) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
 * const evens = Chunk.filter(doubled, (n) => n % 4 === 0) // [4, 8]
 * const sum = Chunk.reduce(evens, 0, (acc, n) => acc + n) // 12
 * ```

 * ```ts
 * import { Chunk, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Working with Effects
 * const processChunk = (chunk: Chunk.Chunk<number>) =>

 *
 * The main benefits of using `Data` types are:
 * - **Structural equality**: Two `Data` objects are equal if their contents are equal
 * - **Immutability**: `Data` types are designed to be immutable
 * - **Type safety**: Constructors ensure type safety and consistency
 * - **Effect integration**: Error types work seamlessly with Effect's error handling
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Data, Equal } from "effect"
 *
 * // Basic struct usage
 * const person1 = Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })
 * const person2 = Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })

/**
 * The `Effect` module is the core of the Effect library, providing a powerful and expressive

 *
 * An `Effect<A, E, R>` represents a computation that:
 * - May succeed with a value of type `A`
 * - May fail with an error of type `E`
 * - Requires a context/environment of type `R`
 *
 * Effects are lazy and immutable - they describe computations that can be executed later.
 * This allows for powerful composition, error handling, resource management, and concurrency
 * patterns.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Type-safe error handling**: Errors are tracked in the type system
 * - **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup with scoped resources
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Safe parallel and concurrent execution
 * - **Composable**: Effects can be combined using operators like `flatMap`, `map`, `zip`
 * - **Testable**: Built-in support for testing with controlled environments
 * - **Interruptible**: Effects can be safely interrupted and cancelled
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
 *
 * // Creating a simple effect

 *
 * Key characteristics of Fibers:
 * - **Lightweight**: Much lighter than OS threads, you can create millions
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Parent fibers manage child fiber lifecycles
 * - **Cancellation safety**: Proper resource cleanup when interrupted
 * - **Cooperative**: Fibers yield control at effect boundaries
 * - **Traceable**: Each fiber has an ID for debugging and monitoring
 *
 * Common patterns:
 * - **Fork and join**: Start concurrent work and wait for results
 * - **Race conditions**: Run multiple effects, take the first to complete
 * - **Supervision**: Monitor and restart failed fibers
 * - **Resource management**: Ensure proper cleanup on interruption

/**
 * This module provides utilities for Higher-Kinded Types (HKT) in TypeScript.
 *
 * Higher-Kinded Types are types that take other types as parameters, similar to how
 * functions take values as parameters. They enable generic programming over type
 * constructors, allowing you to write code that works with any container type
 * (like Array, Option, Effect, etc.) in a uniform way.
 *
 * The HKT system in Effect uses TypeLambdas to encode type-level functions that
 * can represent complex type relationships with multiple type parameters, including
 * contravariant, covariant, and invariant positions.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { HKT } from "effect"
 *
 * // Define a TypeLambda for Array
 * interface ArrayTypeLambda extends HKT.TypeLambda {
 *   readonly type: Array<this["Target"]>
 * }
 *
 * // Use Kind to get the concrete type
 * type MyArray = HKT.Kind<ArrayTypeLambda, never, never, never, string>
 * // MyArray is Array<string>

 *
 * The `LogLevel` module provides utilities for managing log levels in Effect applications.
 * It defines a hierarchy of log levels and provides functions for comparing and filtering logs
 * based on their severity.
 *
 * ## Log Level Hierarchy
 *
 * The log levels are ordered from most severe to least severe:
 *
 * 1. **All** - Special level that allows all messages
 * 2. **Fatal** - System is unusable, immediate attention required
 * 3. **Error** - Error conditions that should be investigated
 * 4. **Warn** - Warning conditions that may indicate problems
 * 5. **Info** - Informational messages about normal operation
 * 6. **Debug** - Debug information useful during development
 * 7. **Trace** - Very detailed trace information
 * 8. **None** - Special level that suppresses all messages
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { LogLevel, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Basic log level usage
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   yield* Effect.logFatal("System is shutting down")
 *   yield* Effect.logError("Database connection failed")
 *   yield* Effect.logWarning("Memory usage is high")
 *   yield* Effect.logInfo("User logged in")
 *   yield* Effect.logDebug("Processing request")
 *   yield* Effect.logTrace("Variable value: xyz")
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Level Comparison
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { LogLevel } from "effect"
 *
 * // Check if one level is more severe than another
 * console.log(LogLevel.greaterThan("Error", "Info")) // true
 * console.log(LogLevel.greaterThan("Debug", "Error")) // false
 *
 * // Check if level meets minimum threshold
 * console.log(LogLevel.greaterThanOrEqualTo("Info", "Debug")) // true
 * console.log(LogLevel.lessThan("Trace", "Info")) // true
 * ```
 *
 * ## Filtering by Level
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { LogLevel, Effect, Logger } from "effect"
 *
 * // Create a logger that only logs Error and above
 * const errorLogger = Logger.make((options) => {
 *   if (LogLevel.greaterThanOrEqualTo(options.logLevel, "Error")) {
 *     console.log(`[${options.logLevel}] ${options.message}`)
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * // Production logger - Info and above
 * const productionLogger = Logger.make((options) => {
 *   if (LogLevel.greaterThanOrEqualTo(options.logLevel, "Info")) {
 *     console.log(`${options.date.toISOString()} [${options.logLevel}] ${options.message}`)
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * // Development logger - Debug and above
 * const devLogger = Logger.make((options) => {
 *   if (LogLevel.greaterThanOrEqualTo(options.logLevel, "Debug")) {
 *     console.log(`[${options.logLevel}] ${options.message}`)
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Runtime Configuration
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { LogLevel, Effect, Logger, Config } from "effect"
 *
 * // Configure log level from environment
 * const logLevelConfig = Config.string("LOG_LEVEL").pipe(
 *   Config.withDefault("Info")
 * )
 *
 * const configurableLogger = Effect.gen(function* () {

/**
 * The `effect/match` module provides a type-safe pattern matching system for

 * while enforcing exhaustiveness checking to ensure all cases are handled.
 *
 * Although pattern matching is not yet a native JavaScript feature,
 * `effect/match` offers a reliable implementation that is available today.
 *
 * **How Pattern Matching Works**
 *
 * Pattern matching follows a structured process:
 *
 * - **Creating a matcher**: Define a `Matcher` that operates on either a
 *   specific `Match.type` or `Match.value`.
 *
 * - **Defining patterns**: Use combinators such as `Match.when`, `Match.not`,
 *   and `Match.tag` to specify matching conditions.
 *
 * - **Completing the match**: Apply a finalizer such as `Match.exhaustive`,
 *   `Match.orElse`, or `Match.option` to determine how unmatched cases should
 *   be handled.

 * The `Metric` module provides a comprehensive system for collecting, aggregating, and observing
 * application metrics in Effect applications. It offers type-safe, concurrent metrics that can
 * be used to monitor performance, track business metrics, and gain insights into application behavior.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Five Metric Types**: Counters, Gauges, Frequencies, Histograms, and Summaries
 * - **Type Safety**: Fully typed metrics with compile-time guarantees
 * - **Concurrency Safe**: Thread-safe metrics that work with Effect's concurrency model
 * - **Attributes**: Tag metrics with key-value attributes for filtering and grouping
 * - **Snapshots**: Take point-in-time snapshots of all metrics for reporting
 * - **Runtime Integration**: Automatic fiber runtime metrics collection
 *
 * ## Metric Types
 *
 * ### Counter
 * Tracks cumulative values that only increase or can be reset to zero.
 * Perfect for counting events, requests, errors, etc.
 *
 * ### Gauge
 * Represents a single numerical value that can go up or down.
 * Ideal for current resource usage, temperature, queue sizes, etc.
 *
 * ### Frequency
 * Counts occurrences of discrete string values.
 * Useful for tracking categorical data like HTTP status codes, user actions, etc.
 *
 * ### Histogram
 * Records observations in configurable buckets to analyze distribution.
 * Great for response times, request sizes, and other measured values.
 *
 * ### Summary
 * Calculates quantiles over a sliding time window.
 * Provides statistical insights into value distributions over time.
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Metric } from "effect"
 *
 * // Create metrics
 * const requestCount = Metric.counter("http_requests_total", {
 *   description: "Total number of HTTP requests"
 * })
 *
 * const responseTime = Metric.histogram("http_response_time", {
 *   description: "HTTP response time in milliseconds",
 *   boundaries: Metric.linearBoundaries({ start: 0, width: 50, count: 20 })
 * })
 *
 * // Use metrics in your application
 * const handleRequest = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   yield* Metric.update(requestCount, 1)
 *
 *   const startTime = yield* Effect.clockWith(clock => clock.currentTimeMillis)
 *
 *   // Process request...
 *   yield* Effect.sleep("100 millis")
 *
 *   const endTime = yield* Effect.clockWith(clock => clock.currentTimeMillis)
 *   yield* Metric.update(responseTime, endTime - startTime)
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Attributes and Tagging
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Metric } from "effect"
 *
 * const requestCount = Metric.counter("requests", {
 *   description: "Number of requests by endpoint and method"
 * })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   // Add attributes to metrics
 *   yield* Metric.update(
 *     Metric.withAttributes(requestCount, {
 *       endpoint: "/api/users",
 *       method: "GET"
 *     }),
 *     1
 *   )
 *
 *   // Or use withAttributes for compile-time attributes
 *   const taggedCounter = Metric.withAttributes(requestCount, {
 *     endpoint: "/api/posts",
 *     method: "POST"
 *   })
 *   yield* Metric.update(taggedCounter, 1)
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Advanced Examples
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Metric, Schedule } from "effect"
 *
 * // Business metrics
 * const userSignups = Metric.counter("user_signups_total")
 * const activeUsers = Metric.gauge("active_users_current")
 * const featureUsage = Metric.frequency("feature_usage")
 *
 * // Performance metrics
 * const dbQueryTime = Metric.summary("db_query_duration", {
 *   maxAge: "5 minutes",
 *   maxSize: 1000,
 *   quantiles: [0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99]
 * })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   // Track user signup
 *   yield* Metric.update(userSignups, 1)
 *
 *   // Update active user count
 *   yield* Metric.update(activeUsers, 1250)
 *
 *   // Record feature usage
 *   yield* Metric.update(featureUsage, "dashboard_view")
 *
 *   // Measure database query time
 *   yield* Effect.timed(performDatabaseQuery).pipe(
 *     Effect.tap(([duration]) => Metric.update(dbQueryTime, duration))
 *   )
 * })
 *
 * // Get metric snapshots
 * const getMetrics = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const snapshots = yield* Metric.snapshot

 *
 * The `NonEmptyIterable` module provides types and utilities for working with iterables
 * that are guaranteed to contain at least one element. This provides compile-time
 * safety when working with collections that must not be empty.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantee that the iterable contains at least one element
 * - **Iterator Protocol**: Fully compatible with JavaScript's built-in iteration protocol
 * - **Functional Operations**: Safe operations that preserve the non-empty property
 * - **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead with maximum type safety
 *
 * ## Why NonEmptyIterable?
 *
 * Many operations require non-empty collections to be meaningful:
 * - Finding the maximum or minimum value
 * - Getting the first or last element
 * - Reducing without an initial value
 * - Operations that would otherwise need runtime checks
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { NonEmptyIterable } from "effect"
 *
 * // NonEmptyIterable is a type that represents any iterable with at least one element
 * function processNonEmpty<A>(data: NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<A>): A {
 *   // Safe to get the first element - guaranteed to exist
 *   const [first] = NonEmptyIterable.unprepend(data)
 *   return first
 * }
 *
 * // Using Array.make to create non-empty arrays
 * const numbers = Array.make(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) as unknown as NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<number>
 * const firstNumber = processNonEmpty(numbers) // number
 *
 * // Regular arrays can be asserted as NonEmptyIterable when known to be non-empty
 * const values = [1, 2, 3] as unknown as NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<number>
 * const firstValue = processNonEmpty(values) // number
 *
 * // Custom iterables that are guaranteed non-empty
 * function* generateNumbers(): NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<number> {
 *   yield 1
 *   yield 2
 *   yield 3
 * }
 *
 * const firstGenerated = processNonEmpty(generateNumbers()) // number
 * ```
 *
 * ## Working with Different Iterable Types
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { NonEmptyIterable, Array, Chunk, pipe } from "effect"
 *
 * // Creating non-empty arrays
 * const nonEmptyArray = Array.make(1, 2, 3) as unknown as NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<number>
 *
 * // Working with strings (assert as NonEmptyIterable when known to be non-empty)
 * const nonEmptyString = "hello" as unknown as NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<string>
 * const [firstChar] = NonEmptyIterable.unprepend(nonEmptyString)
 * console.log(firstChar) // "h"
 *
 * // Working with Maps (assert when known to be non-empty)
 * const nonEmptyMap = new Map([
 *   ["key1", "value1"],
 *   ["key2", "value2"]
 * ]) as unknown as NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<[string, string]>
 * const [firstEntry] = NonEmptyIterable.unprepend(nonEmptyMap)
 * console.log(firstEntry) // ["key1", "value1"]
 *
 * // Custom generator functions
 * function* fibonacci(): NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<number> {
 *   let a = 1, b = 1
 *   yield a
 *   while (true) {
 *     yield b
 *     const next = a + b
 *     a = b
 *     b = next
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * const [firstFib, restFib] = NonEmptyIterable.unprepend(fibonacci() as unknown as NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<number>)
 * console.log(firstFib) // 1
 * ```
 *
 * ## Integration with Effect Arrays
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { NonEmptyIterable, Array, Chunk, pipe } from "effect"
 *
 * // Many Array functions work with NonEmptyIterable
 * declare const nonEmptyData: NonEmptyIterable.NonEmptyIterable<number>
 *

 * - if `x <= y` and `y <= x`, then `x == y` (antisymmetry)
 * - if `x <= y` and `y <= z`, then `x <= z` (transitivity)
 *
 * The truth table for compare is defined as follows:
 *
 * | `x <= y` | `x >= y` | Ordering |                       |
 * | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------- |
 * | `true`   | `true`   | `0`      | corresponds to x == y |

 * @fileoverview
 * The Ordering module provides utilities for working with comparison results and ordering operations.
 * An Ordering represents the result of comparing two values, expressing whether the first value is
 * less than (-1), equal to (0), or greater than (1) the second value.
 *
 * This module is fundamental for building comparison functions, sorting algorithms, and implementing
 * ordered data structures. It provides composable operations for combining multiple comparison results
 * and pattern matching on ordering outcomes.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Type-safe representation of comparison results (-1, 0, 1)
 * - Composable operations for combining multiple orderings
 * - Pattern matching utilities for handling different ordering cases
 * - Ordering reversal and combination functions
 * - Integration with Effect's functional programming patterns
 *
 * Common Use Cases:
 * - Implementing custom comparison functions
 * - Building complex sorting criteria
 * - Combining multiple comparison results
 * - Creating ordered data structures
 * - Pattern matching on comparison outcomes
