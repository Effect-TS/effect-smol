/**
 * The `Clock` module provides functionality for time-based operations in Effect applications.
 * It offers precise time measurements, scheduling capabilities, and controlled time management
 * for testing scenarios.
 *
 * The Clock service is a core component of the Effect runtime, providing:
 * - Current time access in milliseconds and nanoseconds
 * - Sleep operations for delaying execution
 * - Time-based scheduling primitives
 * - Testable time control through `TestClock`
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Precise timing**: Access to both millisecond and nanosecond precision
 * - **Sleep operations**: Non-blocking sleep with proper interruption handling
 * - **Service integration**: Seamless integration with Effect's dependency injection
 * - **Testable**: Mock time control for deterministic testing
 * - **Resource-safe**: Automatic cleanup of time-based resources
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Clock, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Get current time in milliseconds
 * const getCurrentTime = Clock.currentTimeMillis
 *
 * // Sleep for 1 second
 * const sleep1Second = Effect.sleep("1 seconds")

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Deferred`, a powerful concurrency

 * Multiple fibers can await the same `Deferred` and will all be notified when it

 *
 * A `Deferred<A, E>` can be:
 * - **Completed successfully** with a value of type `A`
 * - **Failed** with an error of type `E`
 * - **Interrupted** if the fiber setting it is interrupted
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - **Single assignment**: Can only be completed once
 * - **Multiple waiters**: Many fibers can await the same `Deferred`
 * - **Fiber-safe**: Thread-safe operations across concurrent fibers
 * - **Composable**: Works seamlessly with other Effect operations
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts

/**
 * The `Effect` module is the core of the Effect library, providing a powerful and expressive
 * way to model and compose asynchronous, concurrent, and effectful computations.
 *
 * An `Effect<A, E, R>` represents a computation that:
 * - May succeed with a value of type `A`
 * - May fail with an error of type `E`
 * - Requires a context/environment of type `R`
 *
 * Effects are lazy and immutable - they describe computations that can be executed later.
 * This allows for powerful composition, error handling, resource management, and concurrency
 * patterns.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Type-safe error handling**: Errors are tracked in the type system
 * - **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup with scoped resources
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Safe parallel and concurrent execution
 * - **Composable**: Effects can be combined using operators like `flatMap`, `map`, `zip`
 * - **Testable**: Built-in support for testing with controlled environments
 * - **Interruptible**: Effects can be safely interrupted and cancelled
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Console } from "effect/logging"
 *
 * // Creating a simple effect
 * const hello = Effect.succeed("Hello, World!")
 *
 * // Composing effects

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Fiber`, the fundamental unit of

 *
 * Key characteristics of Fibers:
 * - **Lightweight**: Much lighter than OS threads, you can create millions
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Parent fibers manage child fiber lifecycles
 * - **Cancellation safety**: Proper resource cleanup when interrupted
 * - **Cooperative**: Fibers yield control at effect boundaries
 * - **Traceable**: Each fiber has an ID for debugging and monitoring
 *
 * Common patterns:
 * - **Fork and join**: Start concurrent work and wait for results
 * - **Race conditions**: Run multiple effects, take the first to complete
 * - **Supervision**: Monitor and restart failed fibers
 * - **Resource management**: Ensure proper cleanup on interruption

 *
 * **How Pattern Matching Works**
 *
 * Pattern matching follows a structured process:
 *
 * - **Creating a matcher**: Define a `Matcher` that operates on either a
 *   specific `Match.type` or `Match.value`.
 *
 * - **Defining patterns**: Use combinators such as `Match.when`, `Match.not`,
 *   and `Match.tag` to specify matching conditions.
 *
 * - **Completing the match**: Apply a finalizer such as `Match.exhaustive`,
 *   `Match.orElse`, or `Match.option` to determine how unmatched cases should

 * The `Metric` module provides a comprehensive system for collecting, aggregating, and observing
 * application metrics in Effect applications. It offers type-safe, concurrent metrics that can
 * be used to monitor performance, track business metrics, and gain insights into application behavior.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Five Metric Types**: Counters, Gauges, Frequencies, Histograms, and Summaries
 * - **Type Safety**: Fully typed metrics with compile-time guarantees
 * - **Concurrency Safe**: Thread-safe metrics that work with Effect's concurrency model
 * - **Attributes**: Tag metrics with key-value attributes for filtering and grouping
 * - **Snapshots**: Take point-in-time snapshots of all metrics for reporting
 * - **Runtime Integration**: Automatic fiber runtime metrics collection
 *
 * ## Metric Types
 *
 * ### Counter
 * Tracks cumulative values that only increase or can be reset to zero.
 * Perfect for counting events, requests, errors, etc.
 *
 * ### Gauge
 * Represents a single numerical value that can go up or down.
 * Ideal for current resource usage, temperature, queue sizes, etc.
 *
 * ### Frequency
 * Counts occurrences of discrete string values.
 * Useful for tracking categorical data like HTTP status codes, user actions, etc.
 *
 * ### Histogram
 * Records observations in configurable buckets to analyze distribution.
 * Great for response times, request sizes, and other measured values.
 *
 * ### Summary
 * Calculates quantiles over a sliding time window.
 * Provides statistical insights into value distributions over time.
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Metric } from "effect"
 *
 * // Create metrics
 * const requestCount = Metric.counter("http_requests_total", {
 *   description: "Total number of HTTP requests"
 * })
 *
 * const responseTime = Metric.histogram("http_response_time", {
 *   description: "HTTP response time in milliseconds",
 *   boundaries: Metric.linearBoundaries({ start: 0, width: 50, count: 20 })
 * })
 *
 * // Use metrics in your application
 * const handleRequest = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   yield* Metric.update(requestCount, 1)
 *
 *   const startTime = yield* Effect.clockWith(clock => clock.currentTimeMillis)
 *
 *   // Process request...
 *   yield* Effect.sleep("100 millis")
 *
 *   const endTime = yield* Effect.clockWith(clock => clock.currentTimeMillis)
 *   yield* Metric.update(responseTime, endTime - startTime)
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Attributes and Tagging
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Metric } from "effect"
 *
 * const requestCount = Metric.counter("requests", {
 *   description: "Number of requests by endpoint and method"
 * })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   // Add attributes to metrics
 *   yield* Metric.update(
 *     Metric.withAttributes(requestCount, {
 *       endpoint: "/api/users",
 *       method: "GET"
 *     }),
 *     1
 *   )
 *
 *   // Or use withAttributes for compile-time attributes
 *   const taggedCounter = Metric.withAttributes(requestCount, {
 *     endpoint: "/api/posts",
 *     method: "POST"
 *   })
 *   yield* Metric.update(taggedCounter, 1)
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Advanced Examples
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Metric } from "effect"
 * import { Schedule } from "effect"
 *
 * // Business metrics
 * const userSignups = Metric.counter("user_signups_total")
 * const activeUsers = Metric.gauge("active_users_current")
 * const featureUsage = Metric.frequency("feature_usage")
 *
 * // Performance metrics
 * const dbQueryTime = Metric.summary("db_query_duration", {
 *   maxAge: "5 minutes",
 *   maxSize: 1000,
 *   quantiles: [0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99]
 * })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   // Track user signup
 *   yield* Metric.update(userSignups, 1)
 *
 *   // Update active user count
 *   yield* Metric.update(activeUsers, 1250)
 *
 *   // Record feature usage
 *   yield* Metric.update(featureUsage, "dashboard_view")
 *
 *   // Measure database query time
 *   yield* Effect.timed(performDatabaseQuery).pipe(
 *     Effect.tap(([duration]) => Metric.update(dbQueryTime, duration))
 *   )
 * })
 *
 * // Get metric snapshots
 * const getMetrics = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const snapshots = yield* Metric.snapshot
 *
 *   for (const metric of snapshots) {
 *     console.log(`${metric.id}: ${JSON.stringify(metric.state)}`)
