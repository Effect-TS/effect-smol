 * - **Interrupted** if the fiber setting it is interrupted
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - **Single assignment**: Can only be completed once
 * - **Multiple waiters**: Many fibers can await the same `Deferred`
 * - **Fiber-safe**: Thread-safe operations across concurrent fibers
 * - **Composable**: Works seamlessly with other Effect operations
 *

/**
 * The `Effect` module is the core of the Effect library, providing a powerful and expressive

 *
 * An `Effect<A, E, R>` represents a computation that:
 * - May succeed with a value of type `A`
 * - May fail with an error of type `E`
 * - Requires a context/environment of type `R`
 *
 * Effects are lazy and immutable - they describe computations that can be executed later.
 * This allows for powerful composition, error handling, resource management, and concurrency
 * patterns.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Type-safe error handling**: Errors are tracked in the type system
 * - **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup with scoped resources
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Safe parallel and concurrent execution
 * - **Composable**: Effects can be combined using operators like `flatMap`, `map`, `zip`
 * - **Testable**: Built-in support for testing with controlled environments
 * - **Interruptible**: Effects can be safely interrupted and cancelled
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Console } from "effect/logging"
 *
 * // Creating a simple effect

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Fiber`, the fundamental unit of

 * Key characteristics of Fibers:
 * - **Lightweight**: Much lighter than OS threads, you can create millions
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Parent fibers manage child fiber lifecycles
 * - **Cancellation safety**: Proper resource cleanup when interrupted
 * - **Cooperative**: Fibers yield control at effect boundaries
 * - **Traceable**: Each fiber has an ID for debugging and monitoring
 *
 * Common patterns:
 * - **Fork and join**: Start concurrent work and wait for results
 * - **Race conditions**: Run multiple effects, take the first to complete
 * - **Supervision**: Monitor and restart failed fibers
 * - **Resource management**: Ensure proper cleanup on interruption
 *

 * The `Metric` module provides a comprehensive system for collecting, aggregating, and observing
 * application metrics in Effect applications. It offers type-safe, concurrent metrics that can
 * be used to monitor performance, track business metrics, and gain insights into application behavior.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Five Metric Types**: Counters, Gauges, Frequencies, Histograms, and Summaries
 * - **Type Safety**: Fully typed metrics with compile-time guarantees
 * - **Concurrency Safe**: Thread-safe metrics that work with Effect's concurrency model
 * - **Attributes**: Tag metrics with key-value attributes for filtering and grouping
 * - **Snapshots**: Take point-in-time snapshots of all metrics for reporting
 * - **Runtime Integration**: Automatic fiber runtime metrics collection
 *
 * ## Metric Types
 *
 * ### Counter
 * Tracks cumulative values that only increase or can be reset to zero.
 * Perfect for counting events, requests, errors, etc.
 *
 * ### Gauge
 * Represents a single numerical value that can go up or down.
 * Ideal for current resource usage, temperature, queue sizes, etc.
 *
 * ### Frequency
 * Counts occurrences of discrete string values.
 * Useful for tracking categorical data like HTTP status codes, user actions, etc.
 *
 * ### Histogram
 * Records observations in configurable buckets to analyze distribution.
 * Great for response times, request sizes, and other measured values.
 *
 * ### Summary
 * Calculates quantiles over a sliding time window.
 * Provides statistical insights into value distributions over time.
 *
 * ## Basic Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Metric } from "effect"
 *
 * // Create metrics
 * const requestCount = Metric.counter("http_requests_total", {
 *   description: "Total number of HTTP requests"
 * })
 *
 * const responseTime = Metric.histogram("http_response_time", {
 *   description: "HTTP response time in milliseconds",
 *   boundaries: Metric.linearBoundaries({ start: 0, width: 50, count: 20 })
 * })
 *
 * // Use metrics in your application
 * const handleRequest = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   yield* Metric.update(requestCount, 1)
 *
 *   const startTime = yield* Effect.clockWith(clock => clock.currentTimeMillis)
 *
 *   // Process request...
 *   yield* Effect.sleep("100 millis")
 *
 *   const endTime = yield* Effect.clockWith(clock => clock.currentTimeMillis)
 *   yield* Metric.update(responseTime, endTime - startTime)
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Attributes and Tagging
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Metric } from "effect"
 *
 * const requestCount = Metric.counter("requests", {
 *   description: "Number of requests by endpoint and method"
 * })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   // Add attributes to metrics
 *   yield* Metric.update(
 *     Metric.withAttributes(requestCount, {
 *       endpoint: "/api/users",
 *       method: "GET"
 *     }),
 *     1
 *   )
 *
 *   // Or use withAttributes for compile-time attributes
 *   const taggedCounter = Metric.withAttributes(requestCount, {
 *     endpoint: "/api/posts",
 *     method: "POST"
 *   })
 *   yield* Metric.update(taggedCounter, 1)
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ## Advanced Examples
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Metric } from "effect"
 * import { Schedule } from "effect"
 *
 * // Business metrics
 * const userSignups = Metric.counter("user_signups_total")
 * const activeUsers = Metric.gauge("active_users_current")
 * const featureUsage = Metric.frequency("feature_usage")
 *
 * // Performance metrics
 * const dbQueryTime = Metric.summary("db_query_duration", {
 *   maxAge: "5 minutes",
 *   maxSize: 1000,
 *   quantiles: [0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99]
 * })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   // Track user signup
 *   yield* Metric.update(userSignups, 1)
 *
 *   // Update active user count
 *   yield* Metric.update(activeUsers, 1250)
 *
 *   // Record feature usage
 *   yield* Metric.update(featureUsage, "dashboard_view")
 *
 *   // Measure database query time
 *   yield* Effect.timed(performDatabaseQuery).pipe(
 *     Effect.tap(([duration]) => Metric.update(dbQueryTime, duration))
 *   )
 * })
 *
 * // Get metric snapshots
 * const getMetrics = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const snapshots = yield* Metric.snapshot
 *
 *   for (const metric of snapshots) {
 *     console.log(`${metric.id}: ${JSON.stringify(metric.state)}`)

/**
 * This module provides utilities for creating and composing schedules for retrying operations,
 * repeating effects, and implementing various timing strategies.
 *
 * A Schedule is a function that takes an input and returns a decision whether to continue or halt,
 * along with a delay duration. Schedules can be combined, transformed, and used to implement
 * sophisticated retry and repetition logic.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect, Schedule, Duration } from "effect"
 *
 * // Retry with exponential backoff
 * const retryPolicy = Schedule.exponential("100 millis", 2.0)
 *   .pipe(Schedule.compose(Schedule.recurs(3)))
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   // This will retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
 *   const result = yield* Effect.retry(
 *     Effect.fail("Network error"),
 *     retryPolicy
 *   )
 * })
 *
 * // Repeat on a fixed schedule
 * const heartbeat = Effect.log("heartbeat")
 *   .pipe(Effect.repeat(Schedule.spaced("30 seconds")))
 * ```

/**
 * The `Scope` module provides functionality for managing resource lifecycles
 * and cleanup operations in a functional and composable manner.
 *
 * A `Scope` represents a context where resources can be acquired and automatically
 * cleaned up when the scope is closed. This is essential for managing resources
 * like file handles, database connections, or any other resources that need
 * proper cleanup.
 *
 * Scopes support both sequential and parallel finalization strategies:
 * - Sequential: Finalizers run one after another in reverse order of registration
 * - Parallel: Finalizers run concurrently for better performance
 *

export * as Scope from "./Scope.ts"

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with scoped caching in Effect applications.
 * A `ScopedCache` is similar to a regular cache but ensures that cached values are properly
 * cleaned up when their associated scope is closed. This is essential for managing cached
 * resources that need proper cleanup, such as database connections, file handles, or other
 * resources with lifecycles.
 *
 * The `ScopedCache` data type represents a concurrent-safe, asynchronous cache that stores
 * the results of effects within a scope. When a value is not present in the cache, the cache
 * will compute the value using a provided lookup function, store the result in the current
 * scope, and return it. When the scope is closed, all cached values are automatically
 * cleaned up.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Scoped resource management**: Cached values are tied to scopes for automatic cleanup
 * - **Concurrent-safe**: Multiple fibers can safely access the cache simultaneously
 * - **Asynchronous**: Supports caching of effects that may fail or take time
 * - **Configurable capacity**: Control memory usage with maximum entry limits
 * - **TTL support**: Automatic expiration of cached entries after a time-to-live
 * - **Resource-safe**: Proper cleanup when scopes are closed or operations are interrupted
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ScopedCache, Effect, Duration, Scope } from "effect"
 *
 * // Mock database connection interface
 * interface Connection {
 *   readonly url: string
 *   close(): void
 * }
 *
 * // Mock connection factory
 * const createConnection = (dbUrl: string): Connection => ({
 *   url: dbUrl,
 *   close: () => console.log(`Closing connection to ${dbUrl}`)
 * })
 *
 * // Create a scoped cache for database connections
 * const connectionCache = ScopedCache.make({
 *   capacity: 10,
 *   lookup: (dbUrl: string) =>
 *     Effect.acquireRelease(
 *       Effect.sync(() => createConnection(dbUrl)),
 *       (conn) => Effect.sync(() => conn.close())
 *     )
 * })
 *
 * // Use the cache within a scope
 * const program = Effect.scoped(
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const cache = yield* connectionCache
 *
 *     // First call creates and caches the connection
 *     const conn1 = yield* ScopedCache.get(cache, "postgresql://localhost/db1")
 *
 *     // Second call returns cached connection
 *     const conn2 = yield* ScopedCache.get(cache, "postgresql://localhost/db1")
 *
 *     // Use connections...
 *     // All connections will be automatically closed when scope ends
 *   })
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ScopedCache, Effect, Duration } from "effect"
 *
 * // Create a cache with TTL for API responses
 * const apiCache = ScopedCache.make({
 *   capacity: 50,
 *   timeToLive: Duration.minutes(5),
 *   lookup: (endpoint: string) =>
 *     Effect.scoped(
 *       Effect.acquireRelease(
 *         Effect.tryPromise(() => fetch(endpoint).then(res => res.json())),
 *         () => Effect.void // cleanup if needed
 *       )
 *     )
 * })
 *
 * const program = Effect.scoped(
 *   Effect.gen(function* () {
 *     const cache = yield* apiCache
 *
 *     // Cache API responses within the scope
 *     const data1 = yield* ScopedCache.get(cache, "/api/users")
 *     const data2 = yield* ScopedCache.get(cache, "/api/posts")
 *
 *     // Within 5 minutes, same requests return cached data
 *     const cached = yield* ScopedCache.get(cache, "/api/users")
