 * This module provides a re-export of the fast-check library for property-based testing.
 * Fast-check is a property-based testing framework that generates random test cases
 * to validate that properties hold true for a wide range of inputs.
 *
 * Property-based testing is a testing methodology where you specify properties that
 * should hold true for your functions, and the framework generates many random test
 * cases to try to find counterexamples.
