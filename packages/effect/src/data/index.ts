/**
 * This module provides utility functions and type class instances for working with the `BigDecimal` type in TypeScript.
 * It includes functions for basic arithmetic operations, as well as type class instances for `Equivalence` and `Order`.
 *
 * A `BigDecimal` allows storing any real number to arbitrary precision; which avoids common floating point errors
 * (such as 0.1 + 0.2 â‰  0.3) at the cost of complexity.
 *
 * Internally, `BigDecimal` uses a `BigInt` object, paired with a 64-bit integer which determines the position of the
 * decimal point. Therefore, the precision *is not* actually arbitrary, but limited to 2<sup>63</sup> decimal places.
 *
 * It is not recommended to convert a floating point number to a decimal directly, as the floating point representation
 * may be unexpected.

/**
 * This module provides types and utility functions to create and work with
 * branded types, which are TypeScript types with an added type tag to prevent
 * accidental usage of a value in the wrong context.
 *
 * The `refined` and `nominal` functions are both used to create branded types
 * in TypeScript. The main difference between them is that `refined` allows for
 * validation of the data, while `nominal` does not.
 *
 * The `nominal` function is used to create a new branded type that has the same
 * underlying type as the input, but with a different name. This is useful when
 * you want to distinguish between two values of the same type that have
 * different meanings. The `nominal` function does not perform any validation of
 * the input data.
 *
 * On the other hand, the `refined` function is used to create a new branded
 * type that has the same underlying type as the input, but with a different
 * name, and it also allows for validation of the input data. The `refined`
 * function takes a predicate that is used to validate the input data. If the
 * input data fails the validation, a `BrandErrors` is returned, which provides
 * information about the specific validation failure.

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Cause`, a data type that represents

 * A `Cause` can represent:
 * - **Fail**: A typed, expected error that can be handled
 * - **Die**: An unrecoverable defect (like a programming error)
 * - **Interrupt**: A fiber interruption
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Cause } from "effect/data"
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Creating different types of causes
 * const failCause = Cause.fail("Something went wrong")
 * const dieCause = Cause.die(new Error("Unexpected error"))
 * const interruptCause = Cause.interrupt(123)

 * // Working with effects that can fail
 * const program = Effect.fail("user error").pipe(
 *   Effect.catchCause((cause) => {

/**
 * This module provides utilities for creating data types with structural equality
 * semantics. Unlike regular JavaScript objects, `Data` types support value-based
 * equality comparison using the `Equal` module.
 *
 * The main benefits of using `Data` types are:
 * - **Structural equality**: Two `Data` objects are equal if their contents are equal
 * - **Immutability**: `Data` types are designed to be immutable
 * - **Type safety**: Constructors ensure type safety and consistency
 * - **Effect integration**: Error types work seamlessly with Effect's error handling
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Equal } from "effect/interfaces"
 * import { Data } from "effect/data"
 *
 * // Basic struct usage
 * const person1 = Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })
 * const person2 = Data.struct({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })
 *
 * console.log(Equal.equals(person1, person2)) // true
 * console.log(person1 === person2) // false (different references)
 *
 * // Regular objects don't have structural equality
 * const obj1 = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
 * const obj2 = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
 * console.log(Equal.equals(obj1, obj2)) // false
 *
 * // Tagged enums for discriminated unions
 * const { Success, Failure, $match } = Data.taggedEnum<
 *   | { _tag: "Success"; value: number }
 *   | { _tag: "Failure"; error: string }
 * >()
 *
 * const result1 = Success({ value: 42 })
 * const result2 = Failure({ error: "Not found" })
 *
 * // Pattern matching
 * const message = $match(result1, {
 *   Success: ({ value }) => `Got value: ${value}`,

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with equivalence relations - binary relations that are
 * reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Equivalence relations define when two values of the same type
 * should be considered equivalent, which is fundamental for comparing, deduplicating, and organizing data.
 *
 * An equivalence relation must satisfy three properties:
 * - **Reflexive**: Every value is equivalent to itself
 * - **Symmetric**: If `a` is equivalent to `b`, then `b` is equivalent to `a`
 * - **Transitive**: If `a` is equivalent to `b` and `b` is equivalent to `c`, then `a` is equivalent to `c`
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Equivalence } from "effect/data"
 * import { Array } from "effect/collections"
 *
 * // Case-insensitive string equivalence
 * const caseInsensitive = Equivalence.make<string>((a, b) =>
 *   a.toLowerCase() === b.toLowerCase()
 * )
 *
 * // Use with array deduplication
 * const strings = ["Hello", "world", "HELLO", "World"]
 * const deduplicated = Array.dedupeWith(strings, caseInsensitive)
 * console.log(deduplicated) // ["Hello", "world"]
 *
 * // Product type equivalence

 * - if `x <= y` and `y <= x`, then `x == y` (antisymmetry)
 * - if `x <= y` and `y <= z`, then `x <= z` (transitivity)

 * | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------- |
 * | `true`   | `true`   | `0`      | corresponds to x == y |

 * The Ordering module provides utilities for working with comparison results and ordering operations.

 *
 * This module is fundamental for building comparison functions, sorting algorithms, and implementing
 * ordered data structures. It provides composable operations for combining multiple comparison results
 * and pattern matching on ordering outcomes.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Type-safe representation of comparison results (-1, 0, 1)
 * - Composable operations for combining multiple orderings
 * - Pattern matching utilities for handling different ordering cases
 * - Ordering reversal and combination functions
 * - Integration with Effect's functional programming patterns
 *
 * Common Use Cases:
 * - Implementing custom comparison functions
 * - Building complex sorting criteria
 * - Combining multiple comparison results
 * - Creating ordered data structures
 * - Pattern matching on comparison outcomes
