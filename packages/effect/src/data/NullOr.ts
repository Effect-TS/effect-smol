/**
 * This module provides small, allocation-free utilities for working with values of type
 * `A | null`, where `null` means "no value".
 *
 * Why not `Option<A>`?
 * In TypeScript, `Option<A>` is often unnecessary. If `null` already models absence
 * in your domain, using `A | null` keeps types simple, avoids extra wrappers, and
 * reduces overhead. The key is that `A` itself must not include `null`; in this
 * module `null` is reserved to mean "no value".
 *
 * When to use `A | null`:
 * - Absence can be represented by `null` in your domain model.
 * - You do not need to distinguish between "no value" and "value is null".
 * - You want straightforward ergonomics and zero extra allocations.
 *
 * When to prefer `Option<A>`:
 * - You must distinguish `None` from `Some(null)` (that is, `null` is a valid
 *   payload and carries meaning on its own).
 * - You need a tagged representation for serialization or pattern matching across
 *   boundaries where `null` would be ambiguous.
 * - You want the richer `Option` API and are comfortable with the extra wrapper.
 *
 * Lawfulness note:
 * All helpers treat `null` as absence. Do not use these utilities with payloads
 * where `A` can itself be `null`, or you will lose information. If you need to
 * carry `null` as a valid payload, use `Option<A>` instead.
